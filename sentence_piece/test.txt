it is also written as 木華佐久耶姫 , 木花之佐久夜毘売 , or 木花開耶姫 .
Sakamizu onomikoto ( 佐牙弥豆男 ) and Sakamizu menomikoto ( 佐牙弥豆女神 ) - Same as &quot; 酒弥豆男神 &quot; and &quot; 酒弥豆女神 , &quot; as well as &quot; 酒美豆男 &quot; and &quot; 酒美豆女 . &quot;
medical springs are further categorized as follows based on the dissolved ingredients and their amounts .
mass of dissolved ingredients ( exclusive of those that are in the form of gas ) 1g / kg or above
mass of dissolved ingredients ( excluding those that are in the form of gas ) below 1 g / kg as well as temperature is 25 degree or above .
springs that contain specified ingredients more than the designated amount
hot springs are categorized based on their ingredients .
further , the results of the above categorization are shown in three ways as Keijiyo senshitsumei ( name of recognized spring quality ) , Kyu senshitsumei ( old name for spring quality ) and Shin senshitsumei ( new name for spring quality ) .
the following are categorizations based on Keijiyo senshitsumei .
for categorization of hot springs , also refer to the quality of hot springs .
health benefits of each type of hot spring described below are mere yardsticks and attention should be paid to the fact that such descriptions don &apos;t guarantee health benefits to all people .
simple hot springs are hot springs whereby the amount of contained minerals and gas are less ( less than 1 g per 1 kg of hot spring water ) .
they are not so pungent and mild to skin .
they are clear and colorless and have neither taste nor smell .
they are believed to be effective for neuralgia , muscle pain , arthralgia , blows , sprains , sensitivity to cold , fatigue recovery and health promotion .
however , these are not the effect of contained ingredients , but the effect of improved circulation resulting from the warm bath .
simple hot springs are often misunderstood as low quality hot springs since they contain little ingredients .
the definition of simple hot spring is made solely based upon the amount of contained ingredients and the kinds of ingredients are not taken into account .
even though categorized into simple hot springs , the quality of each hot spring varies widely and simple comparison / categorization of them is not possible .
depending upon the relative proportions of each ingredient , some simple hot springs have similar quality with hot springs that are described below .
further , some simple hot springs have good quality with small amount of various ingredients contained in proper balance .
sulfur springs are hot springs which contain 2 mg or more of total sulfur in 1 kg of hot spring water .
they are white-colored and have the smell of addled eggs .
their temperature is relatively high and they are effective for pimples , oily skin , skin diseases , rheumatism , bronchial asthma and women &apos;s diseases .
they are also effective for diabetes since sulfur ion promotes the production of insulin .
hydrogen sulfide is poisonous and strongly irritates mucosae , skins and respiratory organs .
persons whose physical strength has declined due to illness or those with dry skin should pay attention in particular .
sometimes it is not appropriate for the patients of rheumatism and asthma to bathe in sulfur hot springs without careful consideration .
when the patient in question wants to bathe in sulfur hot springs , it is desirable to consult a doctor in advance .
as hydrogen sulfide corrodes metals , accessories made of metals other than gold and platinum should be removed from the body .
in particular , silver reacts strongly to sulfur and becomes black losing its gloss .
chloride springs are hot springs that contain 1 g or more of ingredients in 1 kg of hot spring water and the principal ingredients of negative ions are chloride ions .
they are principally effective for injuries , chronic skin diseases , blows , sprains , chronic rheumatism , infertility , gout and vascular sclerosis .
drinking of chloride spring water is effective for chronic digestive diseases ( drinking should be done according to instructions from a doctor , at the place where drinking is permitted as well as in compliance with the necessary precautions ) .
ferruginous springs are hot springs that contain 20 mg or more of total iron ion in 1 kg of hot spring water .
their color is brownish-red because iron contained in the water becomes oxidized upon exposure to air .
they have the effect of sterilizing and disinfecting .
as this type of hot springs has a high moisturizing effect , they are effective for warming the body as well as for anemia .
cupriferous and ferruginous springs are hot springs that contain copper and iron .
their color is yellow because metals contained in the water become oxidized upon exposure to air .
like in the case of ferruginous springs , there are two kinds of cupriferous and ferruginous springs , namely hydrogen carbonate springs and sulfate springs .
they are effective for blood diseases and high blood pressure .
Aluminous springs are hot springs whose principal ingredient is aluminum .
their Kyu senshitsumei is Myobansen ( alum spring ) or Ryokubansen ( melanterite spring ) etc .
they have the effect of sterilizing and disinfecting .
they are effective for the recovery of a firm skin as well as chronic skin diseases , athlete &apos;s foot and hives .
Myobansen is believed to be effective for eye problems in particular .
acidic springs are hot springs that contain a mass of hydrogen ion .
in many cases , hydrogen ion is contained in the water in the form of liberated sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid .
they are pungent and effective for sterilizing .
they are also effective for enhancing natural healing ability by stimulating new skin while removing old skin .
they are effective for chronic skin diseases such as athlete &apos;s foot and eczema .
persons whose skin is sensitive are required to either refrain from bathing or should wash their body thoroughly with fresh water after bathing .
hydrogen carbonate springs are springs that contain acids and bases .
hydrogen carbonate springs are divided into sodium hydrogen carbonate springs and bicarbonate-earth springs .
sodium bicarbonate springs are believed to be effective for making skin smooth and beautiful .
they are also effective for fatigue recovery , recuperation after illness , injuries and skin diseases .
drinking this spring water is said to be effective for stomach inflammation .
as bicarbonate-earth springs have an anti-inflammation effect , they are effective for injuries , skin diseases , atopic dermatitis and allergy diseases .
drinking this water is believed to be effective for gout , uric acid stones and diabetes .
though these types of hot springs are suitable for everybody , minimal inflammation could occur , depending on the strength of alkaline , on the areas where skin is sensitive .
though such inflammation is temporary in nature , it is desirable for persons with sensitive skin to wash their bodies with fresh water after bathing .
carbon dioxide springs are hot springs which contain 1 g or more of liberated carbonic acid in 1 kg of hot spring water .
they are effective for improving heart disease and high blood pressure .
drinking this water is believed to be effective for constipation and anorexia .
as the above effects are resulted from lowering oxygen partial pressure in the blood , persons with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases should be careful when bathing as bathing could worsen their condition due to excessive stimulation .
when such patients want to bathe in carbon dioxide springs , it is desirable for them to consult a doctor in advance .
even if permitted to bathe , it is better to avoid prolonged bathing .
Radioactive springs are hot springs which contain 3 nanocuries or more of Radon in 1 kg of hot spring water .
it is contemplated that radiation emitted from such ingredient is unlikely to cause injury to human bodies and it might be good for health since it activates immunity by the Hormesis effect .
this type of hot spring is believed to be effective for various diseases , including skin diseases , women &apos;s diseases and injuries .
they are especially effective for gout , low blood pressure and cardiovascular problems .
it is also said that such radiation could hinder cancer growth .
however , as any of diseases mentioned above have not been firmly proved to be susceptible to radiation and therefore , research in this regard is expected .
Misasa Medical Center of Okayama University Medical School has been established at Misasa-onsen Hot Spring with the aim of proving the therapeutic efficacy of Radon hot springs and is conducting research activities on a full-scale .
sulfate springs containing hydrosulfate .
they have a bitter taste .
sulfate springs are divided into sodium sulfate springs , gypsum springs , and magnesium sulfate springs .
they have the effect of improving the circulation of blood .
they are effective for injuries , gout , stiff shoulder , low back pain , and neuralgia .
drinking the water is effective for constipation and hives .
as hydrosulfate has the effect of easing the stiff part ( stiff skin ) and making easier to move , sulfate springs are quite effective for gout and neuralgia .
among sulfate springs , those containing calcium sulfate have thick and smooth tactile impression .
this is because calcium sulfate is the component of gypsum .
though in rare cases , sulfate springs are misunderstood as dangerous because they contain sulfuric acid .
while sulfuric acid is hazardous substance , sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate etc. are harmless substances .
unlike hydrogen sulfide springs , they don &apos;t emit a bad smell .
sulfate springs have no particular harmful influence on human bodies except for persons who are prohibited to bathe in hot springs .
many house-hold bath agents have a similar composition as that found in sulfate springs .
the notational system of character reference to Onsen mark is &amp; # x2668 ; ( &amp; # 9832 ; ) .
there are three views on its origin .
concerning the details , refer to Onsen mark .
the purposes of the use of hot springs around the world are basically divided into several categories ; namely , taking a rest through bathing ( it is mainstream in Japan ) , recuperation by bathing , enjoying while bathing ( such as swimming ) , drinking ( drinking of hot spring water ) and utilizing steam ( sauna and steam bath ) .
taking a rest by bathing is a unique Japanese culture which reflects its humid climate ( Japanese-style bathing is spread exceptionally in some regions in Asia ) .
globally , hot springs are considered to be used for enjoying , healing , drinking or steaming .
however , thanks to the current Japanese cultural boom as well as the spread of Onsen culture ( to be mentioned later ) , Japanese-style bathing is gradually spreading globally .
in Europe , &apos; drinking hot spring water , &apos; namely drinking of hot spring water , is deeply rooted as hot spring culture in particular .
Carlsbad , a famous hot spring after which the name of Carls hot spring was created , is a hot spring for drinking .
in Europe , however , bathing was the mainstream up to 15th century .
however , hot spring resorts didn &apos;t develop there because of the small quantity of hot spring water as well as its low temperature resulting from the lack of a volcanic belt .
in addition , bathing was considered to be harmful for a body due to the spread of infectious diseases , such as the plague , as well as social background including religious reasons and the practice of bathing was shied away from by people ( concerning the details , refer to the item of bathing ) .
on the other hand , as the quality of drinking water was poor in Europe , some visitors to hot spring resorts used to drink hot spring water .
many of the hot spring resorts took advantage of the above and started to sell bottled hot spring water .
such bottled hot spring water gained a good reputation and since then , the notion of &quot; hot spring was water to drink , &quot; namely the practice of drinking hot spring water took root as culture .
Evian ( mineral water ) and Vichy , well-known brand of bottled water , make use of hot spring water .
in Japan , Wilkinson Ginger Ail originally used hot spring water as an ingredient .
as the drinking of hot spring water showed clear medical effects , it was soon associated with medical science .
in Japan , by contrast , spa therapy had been deemed as folk therapy for a while because of the adoration for the newly imported western medicine and spa research was delayed .
( however , research activities was continuously conducted at Beppu-onsen Hot Spring , where the big-scale facilities for sick and wounded soldiers were operated by Army / Navy , and Misasa-onsen Hot Spring by establishing a hot spring hospital and in cooperation with neighboring universities . )
bath and Carlsbad , well-known as the town of hot spring currently , have developed as health resorts and there are hot spring hospitals and nursing homes at present .
like in Japan , recuperation in a hot spring is also common in Europe .
although hotels and restaurants also exist , they don &apos;t have the facilities for hot spring bathing inside the building ( the fact that the climate in Europe , especially in west and east Europe , is not so humid as Japan is a big reason why the culture of bathing has not developed ) .
instead , they have facilities for drinking hot spring water and hot spring water drinking bars ( bar ) .
by contrast , limited number of hot spring resorts , such as Baden-Baden and Spa , were places for bathing originally .
unlike in Japan , however , the notion of &apos; soaking &apos; doesn &apos;t exist even at these places .
Baden-Baden in Germany has developed as a resort town where casinos , boutiques , jewel shops and high-grade hotels are located , rather than as a hot spring resort .
hot spring water is also used for saunas and showers .
other than the above , there are public baths and many people swim in a big bath using hot spring water in the same fashion as in a swimming pool ( swimming is deemed as the breach of manners in Japan ) .
unlike in Japan , the practice of bathing naked doesn &apos;t exist in Europe and people wear swimsuits .
therefore , many of baths have no seperation between men and women .
in this sense , public baths can be said as the place where people get used to hot water , something like hot swimming pools in Japan .
the situation in New Zealand to be mentioned later is similar to Europe .
spas in Belgium , which have became the common name for international hot spring resorts , have developed as hot springs for recuperation .
as its hot spring district is small and baths for recuperation are set in each hotel room , its atmosphere resembles to that of hot springs for toji in Japan .
however , bathing is done solely for the purpose of recuperation and unlike in Japan , the notion of &quot; soaking leisurely and relieving fatigue &quot; doesn &apos;t exist .
hot spring culture in Hungary , where public baths were constructed during the ancient Roman period , has a history of nearly 2000 years .
Budapest is rich in hot springs .
there also exists a hot water lake ( Lake Hévíz ) .
in America , some hot springs are scattered along the volcanic belt , though the number is less than in Japan .
the most famous one among them are the Hot Springs in Arkansas .
in 1541 , the Spanish discovered a hot spring which had been used by indigenous people from long ago and named it Hot Springs ( namely , the place where hot water gushes out ) .
however , in spite of the abundant quantity of hot spring water , bathing is not necessary there because the humidity level is as low as in Europe .
therefore , hot spring water is only used for showers , saunas and massage and the development of the town is supported by casinos and resort facilities .
further , hot spring water of Hot Springs has been believed to be good for health without concrete grounds and there has been no affiliation between hot springs and medical science .
under such circumstances , hot spring exploitation itself is in the stage of development relative to the size of the country .
hot spring culture of &quot; soaking , &quot; similar to that of Japan , is rooted in the Republic of Korea .
this is the result of Japanese people &apos;s exploitation of hot springs in Korean Peninsula in the wake of Japan &apos;s annexation of Korean Peninsula .
though there are few volcanoes in Korea , there are a lot of hot springs with high temperatures .
Japanese people who visit hot springs in Korea for the first time sometimes suffer culture shock due to the difference in culture between two countries ( for example , Koreans bring nothing when bathing ) .
there exists traditional steam bath called Asemushi ( sweat sauna ) .
in Oceania , New Zealand is famous for having a lot of hot springs .
there are many hot springs thanks to the presence of many volcanoes .
indigenous people Maori knew the benefits of hot springs and used them for recuperation .
in the early 20th century , New Zealand strived to develop hot spring resorts nationwide taking advantage of its abundant hot spring water .
such development , however , didn &apos;t progress very much because its climate was not as humid as that of Japan and the practice of bathing was not prevalent among the white people who settled there .
at present , the use of hot springs in New Zealand is linked with healthcare activities , such as sports and exercise , and hot springs have developed as health resorts where people shed sweat after participating in sports and / or outdoor activities .
swimming pools which use hot spring water are very popular among people and the core facilities of a hot spring town .
the movement to make &apos; Onsen &apos; a global term started around 2003 .
this movement was prompted by the fact that the commonly used English translation of Onsen , &apos; Hot Spring &apos; and &apos; Spa , &apos; mean the place where hot water gushes and hot springs for recuperation respectively ( the latter derives from the city name Spa ( Belgium ) which is famous as the host city of Formula 1 World Championship ) and both of them evoke the image of something different from the Japanese Onsen .
people of Kusatsu-onsen Hot Spring are actively conducting the movement to make &apos; Onsen &apos; a global term .
the &apos; ONSEN Tourism Department &apos; exists in the administrative organization of Beppu City .
probably thanks to the above , foreign tourists whose main purpose is visiting Onsen have been increasing recently .
tours from abroad that specialize in Onsen as well as English web-sites introducing Onsen at various places in Japan are also seen recently .
( de Thermalquelle )
manzai or comic dialogue is a type of entertainment or talk show performed mainly by a comedy duo , which has been uniquely developed in Japan &apos;s Kinki region based upon the traditional form of manzai observed on New Year &apos;s Day .
the witty dialogue and wisecracks from a pair of comedians produces a lot of laughter .
manzai was named by the advertising department of Yoshimoto Kogyo in 1933 after Mandan started by Benshi ( Japanese film narrators for silent movies ) at the end of the Taisho era .
performers who perform manzai are called &apos; Manzai-shi &apos; ( stand-up comedian ) .
manzai seen in the Kansai area is often called Kamigata manzai .
manzai ( written in different kanji from the main topic Manzai ) which is said to be the origin of manzai is a form of entertainment that started in the Heian period to deliver a congratulatory speech for the New Year along with chanting and dancing .
a pair of performers visit each house , with one of them playing the drum and the other dancing with it after delivering a congratulatory speech for the New Year .
in the Edo period , manzai named after its originating location including Owari Manzai , Mikawa Manzai and Yamato Manzai became popular in many places throughout the country , which developed into something much funnier by adding more wisecracks and riddle dialogues to utamai ( a performance of singing and dancing ) .
however , this form of entertainment nearly faded out by the end of World War II .
they have been restored and succeeded in some preservation societies in recent years .
manzai ( written in different kanji used as the main topic and the previously-mentioned Manzai ) , which is an Osaka vaudeville started in the Meiji period , is based upon Sankyoku Manzai , one of many types of manzai .
sankyoku Manzai was a boisterous manzai using a Chinese fiddle , a drum and a shamisen , and the early Manzai was accompanied by some musical instruments after the fashion of Sankyoku Manzai .
some of the early manzai entertainers included Entatsu TAMAGOYA , a pioneer of manzai , and a duo of Sutemaru SUNAGAWA and Haruyo NAKAMURA .
however , vaudeville at the time was mainly comprised of rakugo ( traditional comic storytelling ) and manzai was regarded just as a supporting type of entertainment .
after that , manzai began including elements of Niwaka ( an impromptu comic play ) , Karukuchi , which was transformed from Niwaka and had a form of rakugo played by two persons , as well as Rokyoku ( recitation of a kind of sung narrative ) , and reached its present form .
at the end of the Taisho period , a duo of Entatsu YOKOYAMA and Achako HANABISHI , who were Yoshimoto Kogyo entertainers , established manzai as a talk show called &apos; Shabekuri Manzai &apos; in which entertainers made people laugh only with their conversation , and their style achieved significant popularity .
up to the beginning of Showa period , manzai had been described mainly in either &apos; 萬才 &apos; or &apos; 萬歳 . &apos;
however , when an advertising department was established in Yoshimoto Kogyo in January 1933 which announced in &apos; Yoshimoto Engei Tsushin &apos; that they would change its description in kanji ( Chinese characters ) to &apos; 漫才 . &apos;
therefore , it is now widely accepted that Tetsuhiko HASHIMOTO , who was managing the advertising department at the time , started using the kanji &apos; 漫才 &apos; to describe manzai .
however , some people believe that the person who started using the kanji &apos; 漫才 &apos; to describe manzai was actually Shonosuke HAYASHI , the general manager of Yoshimoto Kogyo at the time , rather than HASHIMOTO since the kanji &apos; 漫才 &apos; had been already used as one of the business line of Yoshimoto Kogyo in March 1932 , when Yoshimoto Kogyo changes its name to Yoshimoto Kogyo Gomei Kaisha .
since the appearance of Entatsu and Achako , the popularity of manzai has rapidly spread among people and many other forms of manzai-shi have emerged .
in Tokyo , Kingoro YANAGIYA who was on familiar terms with Entatsu and Achako was inspired by manzai and thus had Goro and Rokuro of the Yanagiya family perform comical conversation on stage .
the duo later changes their names to Rigaru Senta and Mankichi , and came to be regarded as the origin of today &apos;s Tokyo Manzai .
on the other hand , there were some manzai-shi , who maintained the classic style of using some musical instrument , including Sutemaru SUNAGAWA , Haruyo NAKAMURA , Kashimashi-Musume in Kansai , and Keiko and Yoshie UTSUMI as well as Chiyowaka and Chiyokiku SHOKAKUYA in Tokyo .
in the post war period , many manzai-shi suffered their own partners &apos; death from war , death by disease , and unexplained disappearance , etc .
some manzai-shi , who did not have an exclusivity contract with Yoshimoto Kogyo , gathered in Osaka and established Dannosuke Geino-sha , a company that received orders for and engaged in managing entertainment .
Dannosuke SHOKAKUYA gathered several manzai-shi at Sanno , Nishinari Ward , which was a convenient place for gathering people in terms of public transportation .
accordingly , Sanno was called &quot; Geinin Yokocho &quot; ( entertainers alley ) and became popular among local people .
later , it became easier for entertainers to work in places other than Sanno due to the development of public transportation , and many of them signed a contract with Yoshimoto Kogyo or Shochiku Geino .
the 1950 &apos;s and 60 &apos;s were the heyday of manzai .
popular entertainers on television and radio shows in the Kansai region during the period included duos such as Daimaru and Raketto NAKATA , Itoshi YUMEJI and Koishi KIMI , Miyako Chocho and Yuji NANTO , Koro JINSEI and Sachiko IKUE , Ohama and Kohama UNABARA , and Manga trio .
in Tokyo , the duos of Senta and Mankichi who were described earlier , Tenya SHISHI and Wanya SETO , and Toppu and Raito COLUMBIA were also active on television and radio shows .
in the late 1970 &apos;s , manzai became popular through the TV shows on the Fuji television channel , namely &quot; Kao Meijin Gekijo &quot; and &quot; THE MANZAI , &quot; and some mid-career and young manzai-shi including duos of Yasushi YOKOYAMA and Kiyoshi NISHIKAWA , Kausu and Botan NAKATA , Comedy No.1 , Two-Beat , Sento and Ruisu HOSHI , The Bonchi , Norio NISHIKAWA and Yoshio KAMIGATA , Shinsuke and Ryusuke as well as BB achieved significant popularity .
many of them are still active at the forefront of entertainment today .
manzai was originally developed as a form of entertainment performed in a storyteller theater ; however , manzai has also had a remarkable affinity with the mass media and has thus been frequently shown or introduced on radio and TV shows .
other countries such as the U.S.A. , Germany , Korea and China also have similar types of entertainment ; however , no performance where nori-tsukkomi and dotsuki ( hitting your partner ) are seen in these countries due to cultural differences .
manzai is a talk show performed mainly by a duo , but there are some cases where a trio ( a group of three members ) perform it .
background music may be used or the performers themselves may play some musical instrument .
traditionally , many male performers wore matching costumes or suits , which were tailored with flashy , primary-color lame fabric .
however , the young manzai-shi who were also active as comedians in the manzai boom in 1970 &apos;s started changing the tradition and many of them began wearing more fashionable or informal dress which can be seen on the street .
also , one or both member ( s ) of some comedians and manzai-shi duos sometimes wear unusual costumes in order to represent their unique characters or trademark ( Yoshichi SHIMADA of BB in their younger days , Taka of Taka and Toshi , etc . ) .
no props are used in manzai , in principle ; even when used , the number of the props is quite small .
there are only a few restrictions about costumes and props .
boke and Tsukkomi
roles in manzai can be divided into two types ; boke and tsukkomi .
boke is the role of the comic that is expected to say something funny about the topic .
he / she uses obvious mistakes and misunderstandings to mainly tell silly or funny jokes about the topic , to make the audience laugh .
the partner of the boke comic immediately points out the mistakes or misunderstandings made by the boke comic to show the audience what is funny about it .
common ways to react to the boke comic &apos;s jokes are to slap or hit the boke person &apos;s head with a light item or to hit the chest of the boke person with the back of his / her hand .
this role is called tsukkomi .
boke used to be called toboke because he / she often made the audiences &apos; laugh by acting stupid ( the word is originated from &quot; tobokeru , &quot; which means playing fool in Japanese ) .
in introducing the roles of a duo ( or trio ) as &apos; tsukkomi toboke &apos; on stage , the phrase came to be interpreted as &apos; tsukkomi to boke &apos; ( tsukkomi AND boke ) , which became the current names for each role .
the act of tsukkomi butting in the boke &apos;s jokes is called &apos; tsukkomi wo ireru . &apos;
the timing of tsukkomi itself often provokes laughter of the audience .
tsukkomi also provides a break in the ongoing topic of the boke person and thus is effective in producing brisk structural rhythms .
there is another style of tsukkomi called &apos; nori-tsukkomi &apos; in which a tsukkomi person does not butt in the boke &apos;s joke immediately , but develops the joke further before butting in .
however , the laughter is actually provoked by the tsukkomi person in nori-tsukkomi , and thus is different from the original role of tsukkomi .
according to Daijisen ( a type of Japanese dictionary ) , tsukkomi is a role that develops a plot of the topic ; however , that is not necessarily so .
there are quite a few duos or trios of manzai-shi where the boke person ( s ) develop the plot .
roles of boke and tsukkomi can be switched around ; versatile entertainers can switch their roles naturally depending on the situation .
therefore , it is a good guess that boke and tsukkomi are not fixed roles in a precise sense , and the exchange of conversation between the two roles is just conceptualized .
examples of manzai duos where the tsukkomi person develops a plot include Nakagawa-ke , Noiru and Koiru SHOWA , and Itoshi YUMEJI and Koishi KIMI .
on the other hand , examples of duos where the boke person develops a plot include Bikkizu , and Daisuke and Hanako MIYAGAWA .
examples of manzai duos where roles of boke and tsukkomi are not fixed include Daimaru and Raketto NAKATA , Yasushi YOKOYAMA and Kiyoshi NISHIKAWA , Kausu and Botan NAKATA , All Hanshin and Kyojin , Tomiizu , and Kenta and Yuta OKA .
as mentioned earlier , there were not a few manzai-shi whose roles of boke and tsukkomi were not fixed .
however , since the teacher-student system collapsed and new generations who have learned manzai at a manzai training school ( the third comedy generation or later ) gained power , most of the comedians in those generations have performed manzai in which their roles of boke and tsukkomi are distinctly divided .
in addition , although the number is still small , there are some manzai duos both of whom play boke roles ( e.g. Waraimeshi ) or tsukkomi roles .
also , some duos have no tsukkomi role and the partner of boke role develops the joke by acting impressed or convinced by it instead of butting in the conversation ( subspecies of manzai duo in which both of them play boke roles ) ( e.g. Shampoo-hat , POISON GIRL BAND , etc . ) .
types of manzai
the form of manzai has a tendency where the style is first established by a pioneering duo , and then patterned by other followers or latecomers .
although people have tried to classify the types of manzai in consideration of such patterns , the classifications are just used to facilitate the description of each manzai and never become established as genres .
&quot; karuta &quot; ( in Chinese characters , written as &quot; 歌留多 , &quot; &quot; 加留多 , &quot; &quot; 嘉留太 , &quot; or &quot; 骨牌 &quot; ) is a kind of a Japanese game using picture cards .
the name karuta originated from the Portuguese word &quot; carta &quot; which means a letter , a paper board or the like , a playing card , and so on .
originally , karuta was a general term for card games including playing cards .
in present Japan , karuta means &quot; hanafuda &quot; ( cards with a printed picture of a flower ) , or the game mentioned below in which players compete for accumulating the most number of picture cards corresponding to &quot; yomifuda &quot; ( cards for calling ) .
about &quot; hyakunin isshu &quot; ( one hundred Japanese poems by one hundred poets ) , which is also called &quot; uta garuta &quot; ( Japanese poem cards ) , a Japanese poem is written on yomifuda and the poem &apos;s latter half is written on &quot; torifuda &quot; ( picture cards for touching ) .
both yomifuda and torifuda correspond to the Japanese syllabary , and there exists one pair of yomifuda and torifuda for each syllable .
&quot; yomifuda &quot;
a short phrase ( or sentence ) - for example , a proverb - is written on it , and a person calling the card - in many cases , an adult - reads it aloud .
torifuda
on this , a picture about the yomifuda &apos;s contents is portrayed and the first syllable of the yomifuda &apos;s phrase ( or sentence ) is written .
and the players try to collect torifuda faster than others when the yomifuda is called .
the game is played with two or more participants .
all torifuda are pkaced on a flat surface - in many cases , on &quot; tatami &quot; ( floor mats for Japanese-style rooms ) - so that they can be seen easily by the players .
a person calls yomifuda .
players try to touch ( flip , or - in some cases - seize ) torifuda corresponding to yomifuda as soon as possible .
the player who is the first to touch the right torifuda gets it .
the process above is repeated until all yomifuda and torifuda are gone .
the player who gets the most torifuda wins .
this game also serves as a way for a child to learn the Japanese syllabary .
the word &quot; karuta &quot; originated from Portuguese , but the game itself , similar to karuta , is thought to have existed in Japan before contact with Portugal .
that is &apos; kaioi &apos; ( or &apos; kaiawase &apos; ) , a game played during the Heian period pairing the two pieces of a clamshell .
and this , combined with a card game originating in Europe , became the present game during the Genroku era .
the most classical and famous karuta cards are those corresponding to traditional Japanese syllabary .
a proverb is on each card , and the proverb differs from place to place , though the syllable is the same .
for example , &quot; Kamigata &quot; ( Kyoto and Osaka area ) , &quot; Edo &quot; ( Kanto area ) and &quot; Owari &quot; ( Aichi area ) each use a different proverb .
the proverb symbolizes each community &apos;s cultural characteristics .
the Edo version begins with the card that says , &apos; Inu mo arukeba bo ni ataru &apos; ( The dog that trots about finds a bone ) .
the cards shown below are the traditional ones .
some of the cards sold on the market as of 2008 are replacements for the old ones .
about the Edo version , the cards that had a difficult or obsolete expession were replaced :
for example , the card that said , &apos; Tsukiyo ni kama wo nukareru , &apos; which literally means , &apos; The cauldron was stolen in the moonlight night , &apos; - the English equivalent is , &apos; Danger comes soonest when it is despised , &apos; - was replaced with the card that says , &apos; Tsuki to suppon &apos; ( As different as day and night ) .
and the card that said , &apos; Soryo no jinroku &apos; ( First born , least clever ) , was replaced with the card that says , &apos; Son shite toku tore &apos; ( Make it your strategy to win by losing ) .
similarly , the card that said , &apos; Imo no nieta mo gozonji nai , &apos; which literally means , &apos; He cannot judge whether the potatoes have got boiled , &apos; - the English equivalent is nonexistent but this can be said a disparaging expression about a person who is not aware of what is taking place under its very nose - and the card that said , &apos; Ko wa sangai no kubikase &apos; ( Children suck the mother when they are young , and the father when they are old ) , were both replaced , too .
and a card that included a vulgar expression was also replaced :
for example , the card that said , &apos; He wo hitte shiri tsubomeru , &apos; which literally means , &apos; To try to close the anus after breaking the wind , &apos; - the English equivalent is , &apos; It is too late to cast an anchor when the ship is on the rocks , &apos; - was replaced with the card that says , &apos; Heta no naga dangi &apos; ( Brevity is the soul of wit ) &#91; This proverb is borrowed from Kamigata &#93; .
in addition , a card that had overtones of discrimination was replaced .
Ryoyaku wa kuchi ni nigashi &apos; ( Advice is seldom welcome ) , was originally a card from the old Japanese syllable orthography of &apos; re , &apos; but it has now become a card of the modern Japanese syllable orthography of &apos; ri , &apos; so the former &apos; ri &apos; card which said , &apos; Richigimono no kodakusan , &apos; which literally means , &apos; Honest and hardworking men have many children , &apos; - the English equivalent is nonexistent - was eliminated .
there are pros and cons about these changes in karuta that reflect the times .
all over Japan , various karuta cards exist in which the traditions and the features of the local community are expressed .
the typical one is &quot; Jomo karuta , &quot; which is popular throughout Gunma Prefecture .
moreover , dialect karuta ( with a compact disc ) is on sale all over Japan , for example in the Hokkaido dialect and in the Tsugaru dialect .
in addition , many kinds of kids &apos; karuta are also put on the market , that feature characters from comic books or animated cartoons .

Tanabata ( Shichiseki ) is one of the days of sekku / sechinichi ( a day of the turn of the season ) in Japan , China , Taiwan , Vietnam , and Korea .
though it refers to the night of July 7 ( lunar calendar ) , Tanabata Matsuri is held in Japan either on July 7 or a month later on August 7 as Bon festival is also held either in July or in August , after the Meiji revision of the calendar .
it is also counted among sekku ( seasonal festivals ) .
in the old days , tanabata ( 七夕 ) was written &quot; 棚機 &quot; or &quot; 棚幡 , &quot;
originally , tanabata was a part of the Bon festival and shoryodana ( 精霊棚 ) ( a shelf for spirits of the dead ) and bata ( 幡 ) ( a kind of flag used for Buddhist events ) used to be prepared on the evening of the 7th .
it is also said that because the evening of the 7th is written in Chinese character as &quot; 七夕 , &quot; people started to pronounce this Chinese character as &quot; tanabata . &quot; .
Tanabata was originally an event celebrated in China and was introduced into Japan during the Nara period .
the term tanabata was born when the above was combined with Japanese indigenous legend of Tanabatatsume .
originally it was one of sekku in China and was celebrated on July 7 based on a lunar-solar calendar ( old calendar ) .
based on Chinese calendar , July ( old calendar ) is the first month of autumn called &quot; moshu &quot; ( beginning of autumn ) and the seventh is the day of waxing moon , namely the day of the half moon .
as July 7 is the day which seven is doubled , it was also called &quot; soshichi &quot; ( double seven ) .
according to Nijushi-sekki ( 24 seasons ) , the day of tanabata falls around the time of risshu ( the first day of autumn ) .
in Japan , the day of tanabata was July 7 on the Japanese calendar such as on the Tenpo calendar ( old calendar ) and was celebrated mostly as a part of the Bon festival , which was held on July 15 ( old calendar ) .
because the time of Bon festival split , depending on the regions , into July and August after the solar calendar was adopted in 1873 , tanabata is currently celebrated either on July 7 of Gregorian calendar ( new calendar ) ( the night of July 6 depending on events ) or on August 7 as a part of Bon festival based on the old calendar ( a month later ) ( mainly , eastern Japan , Hokkaido and Sendai ) .
even at present , tanabata is celebrated on July 7 of the old calendar in some regions .
although there exists a leap July according to the leap month under the old calendar , July 7 of the leap month is not the day of tanabata because no annual events are traditionally held in a leap month .
in recent years , such a case occurred in 2006 ( July 31 coincided with July 7 of the old calendar and August 30 coincided with July 7 of the leap month . in this case , the day of the old calendar-based tanabata is only July 31 and tanabata is not celebrated twice a year ) .
refer to the entry for &apos; Bon festival &apos; concerning the difference in the time ( date ) .
though July 7 of the Gregorian calendar falls on a summer day , July 7 of the old calendar mostly falls after the time of risshu and therefore , the old calendar-based tanabata is a seasonal word for autumn .
as July 7 of the Gregorian calendar falls in the midst of the rainy season in most regions of Japan , it is pointed out that this is one of disadvantages in holding traditional events according to the Gregorian calendar .
according to statistics , the ratio of fine weather on July 7 of the old calendar is about 53 % ( Tokyo ) and it is not particularly high .
however , as July 7 of the old calendar is the day of the waxing moon , the moon sets below the horizon early and the moonlight rarely hinders the view .
the ratio of fine weather on July 7 under the new calendar is low , about 26 % ( Tokyo ) .
further , as the phase of the moon on that day is irregular , the Milky Way could be invisible even on a fine day due to the effect of the moonlight .
therefore , as far as the odds of being able to see the Milky Way is concerned , they are higher on July 7 of the old calendar .
incidentally , if rain falls on the day of tanabata it is called &quot; sairuiu &quot; or &quot; sairuiu &quot; and is believed to be tears which Orihime ( Vega ) and Hikoboshi ( Altair ) shed .
it is thought that tanabata originated as the Japanese traditional festival in which people pray for a good harvest to the spirits of ancestors ( Bon festival ) merged with Kikkoden ( Kikoden ) , a festival imported from China in which women pray for the progress of sewing , and the Buddhist festival of Urabon-e ( Bon festival ) .
Tanabata was originally written as 棚幡 and it is also a part of Bon festival even at present .
sasa ( bamboo branch ) is yorishiro ( object representative of a divine spirit ) at which shorei ( ancestors &apos; spirit ) stay .
when the day of tanabata became a special day is unknown .
the oldest literature which mentioned the events held on this day was &quot; Simin yueling &quot; ( book on agricultural work ) , a book written by Cui Shi in the Later term of the Western Han period , and according to it , people aired out books on the day .
the legend of the Weaver and the Cowherd first appeared in &quot; The Nineteen Old Poems , &quot; compiled during the Han period and selected in &quot; Bunsen ( literature ) &quot; ( Selected Literature ) , but its relationship to July 7 is not clear .
in &quot; Keiso Saijiki &quot; written during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts ( China ) , it was stated that the Cowherd and the Weaver meet on July 7 and on that night , women prayed for the progress of sewing by threading colorful threads into the eyes of seven needles and setting up offerings in the garden .
from the above description , the fact that Kikkoden which was held on July 7 was linked with the legend of the Weaver and the Cowherd is clearly understood .
the following description appears in the &quot; Novel ( In Un ) &quot; written by Inun in the Rikucho Ryo period ( Southern court ) ,
&quot; a lady weaver resided in the east of the Milky Way and she was a child of Tentei ( God of Hosts ) .
she was always busy weaving hagoromo ( feather-robes ) of unkin ( clouds and brocade ) and had no time to make herself up .
Tentei felt pity for her solitude and allowed her to marry Qianniulang ( the Cowherd ) of the west of the river .
when she ceased to weave after being married , Tentei became angry , ordered her to return to the east of the Milky Way and allowed her to meet him only once a year . &quot; ( itsubun - lost writings ) of shichigatsu-ryo in &quot; Getsuryo kogi &quot; )
the above is the oldest historical literature that can verify the currently known story of tanabata .
the origin of &quot; tanabata &quot; in Japanese is believed to be either &quot; ototanabata &quot; ( ototanabata ) , which appears in a poem , according to &quot; Kojiki &quot; ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , written by Ajisukitakahikone when Amenowakahiko died , &quot; ototanabata &quot; , which appears in issho-daiichi of ASHIWARA no Nakatsukuniheitei of &quot; Nihon shoki &quot; ( Chronicles of Japan ) or &quot; tanabata , which derived from shoryodana and bata used for Bon festival .
in Japan , tanabata was celebrated during the Nara period as a seasonal event of the Imperial Court .
in volume 10 of the &quot; Manyo-shu , &quot; some waka poems related to tanabata were compiled including a spring poem 2080 ( &quot; We can meet tonight since today is tanabata . from tommorow , however , we have to wait for an another year . a year is long &quot; ) .
although tanabata was originally one of the court events , it spread in the Edo period among ordinary people as a means of prayer to improve their skills since Orihime ( the Weaver ) excelled in women &apos;s practices such as in weaving cloth .
in the tanabata legend of Japan and China , Vega , first-magnitude star of Lyra , is known as Orihimeboshi ( Shokujosei ) .
Orihime was a daughter of Tentei and was a hard-working woman who excelled in weaving .
Natsuhikoboshi ( Hikoboshi , Kengyusei ) is Altair of Aquila .
Natsuhiko was also a hard-working man and Tentei allowed their marriage .
as their married life was so happy , Orihime ceased to weave cloth and Natsuhiko ceased to raise cows after marriage .
Tentei got angry at the above , separated them , each on either side of the Milky Way and permitted them to meet only once a year on July 7 .
on July 7 , they could meet using the bridge on the Milky Way which was built by a magpie which came flying from an unknown place .
however , if July 7 was a rainy day and the volume of water of the Milky Way increased , Orihime couldn &apos;t cross the bridge and Natsuhiko couldn &apos;t meet her .
as the above rendezvous is between two stars , tanabata is also called hoshiai ( a date between stars ) .
if rain falls on the day , it is called sairuiu .
sairuiu is believed to be the tears that Orihime and Natsuhiko shed .
though the above is the classical story of the tanabata anecdote , various folk stories based on this anecdote were created at many places in China over a long period of history .
these were played at local theaters and became the theme of plays ( China ) .
the most famous among them is &quot; Tengahai &quot; ( the lovers in the Milky Way ) , which is a repertoire of Kyogeki .
the gist of its story is as follows .
Gyuro ( Kengyu ) , a cowherder , stole the clothing of Shokujo , one of Tennyo ( celestial maidens ) , while she was bathing and then married her .
thereafter , Shokujo went up to tenkai ( world of heaven ) and Gyuro followed her , but they were separated by Seiobo , mother of Shokujo , on the east and west side of the Milky Way .
it is Hakucho shojo setsuwa ( swan maiden anecdote ) which is similar to the Hagoromo legend .
although the names of star Shokujo and Kengyu firstly appeared in &quot; Shikyo &quot; ( Chinese poetry book ) compiled in the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period , it is not clear which stars these two pointed to .
according to the Tianguan shu of &quot; Shiki &quot; ( the Chinese Historical records ) , Kengyu at the time was Gyushuku and current Kengyu , namely Altair , is a star belonging to the constellation called Kako ( drum of the Milky Way ) .
it seems that the star was moved , with the development of the tanabata legend , to a position more suitable for the above anecdote .
as July 7 of the lunar-solar calendar , used in China and Japan , is the day of the waxing moon , such a moon was sometimes likened to a ship .
on the day , the moon sets late at night and the Milky Way which has been invisible due to the moonlight , appears .
in recent Japan , however , places where the Milky Way is visible are limited even after the moon has set because of light pollution .
depending on the phase of the moon , the Milky Way is often totally invisible on July 7 by the Gregorian calendar ( new calendar ) due to the moonlight .
most shinto rituals are usually held at &quot; predawn night &quot; ( at 1 am on July 7 ) and the festival is conducted from the night of July 6 till the early morning , during the dawn of July 7 .
as major stars rise around the top of the sky around 1 am , it is the best time to view the Milky Way , Kengyusei and Shokujosei .
by writing wishes on tanzaku ( strips of colored paper ) and hanging them on bamboo branches is a common practice around the nation .
hanging tanzaku on bamboo branches is a unique Japanese practice and it was created during the Edo period based on bamboo set at the both sides of cogon grass ring for Natsugoshi no Oharae ( great purification ceremony ) .
tanzaku &apos;s five colors , which are mentioned in the lyrics of a song &quot; Tanabata-sama , &quot; refer to green , red , yellow , white and black based on Gogyo-setsu ( the theory of five elements ) .
in China , five colored threads are hung instead of five colored tanzaku .
as Kikkoten mentioned above is a festival to pray for improving the technique of the arts , it is believed that wishes to be written on tanzaku are supposed to be about accomplishments .
tanzaku is also influenced by five colored-segakibata of Buddhism which is used at the Buddhist service for segaki ( Hungry Ghosts ) .
as it is believed that grinding an ink stick with drops of dew formed on the leaves of a sweet potato plant is effective for the improvement of calligraphy , seven leaves of paper mulberry on which waka poems are written are offered .
a waka poem composed by the wife of FUJIWARA no Shunzei remains : &quot; as a rudder ( phonetically same as kaji in Japanese ) of a boat crossing the river on the day of tanabata , how many years I have offered poems written on the leaves of kaji with the ink ground with drops of dew ? &quot;
it is a common practice to place a bamboo with tanzaku hanging down on July 6 and at seaside regions , to float it on the sea at dawn on July 7 .
recently , however , plastic products are often used in lieu of bamboo and accordingly , they seldom are floated on the sea .
in some districts , bamboo decorations are displayed on a bridge over a river .
in some regions , the tanabata festival has been united with events of praying for rain or mushiokuri ( torch procession of driving away crop-eating insects ) .
in Hokkaido , a children &apos;s event called &quot; Rosoku-morai &quot; ( give us candles ) &quot; is held on the day of tanabata .
in Sendai City and so on , people eat somen ( fine wheat noodles ) on the day of tanabata .
some say the reason for eating somen is derived from an ancient Chinese historical fact while others assert that people likened somen to threads and by eating it , they wished to be like Orihime who excelled in sewing skills .
recently in Taiwan , tanabata is regarded as the day on which men and women exchange gifts , like St. Valentine &apos;s Day .
on the other hand , in the case of &quot; Tanabata-matsuri &quot; organized by shopping avenues as an event , magnificent tanabata decorations are placed along the street in the daytime and are used as the setting to attract shoppers and tourists .
in this case , attention is rarely paid to the above-mentioned practices conducted during nighttime or shinto rituals .
concerning &quot; Tanabata Matsuri &quot; as an event , refer to the next item .
according to &quot; Koji-ruien &quot; published by Jingu Shicho ( Jingu Administration Office ) , its origin is Shokujo-sai of the Engishiki ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) .
later , it became Tanabata Matsuri ( Tanabata Festival ) .
during the Heian period , Kikkoten was often held in the court and among court nobles .
even at present , the Reizei family has inherited the patterns from those days .
in &quot; Edokanoko &quot; written by Rihei FUJITA in 1687 , there is a description saying &quot; On the day of tanabata , children in Edo offer tanzaku &quot; .
in &quot; Morisada Manko &quot; written by Morisada KITAGAWA , there also is a description saying &quot; The night of July 7 is tanabata . in Osaka , people play throughout the day while beating drums . in Edo , people hang colored tanzaku on a green bamboo and place it high on the roof &quot; .
the above descriptions indicate that tanabata was already celebrated in Edo as early as during the mid-Edo period and at the end of the Edo period , it also flourished in Osaka .
other than the above , there are descriptions in &quot; Kiyu shoran &quot; written by Kintei KITAMURA saying &quot; in around 1829 in Edo from recently &quot; and in &quot; Shojitome &quot; saying &quot; July 1841 , tanabata is celebrated in July annually . &quot;
further , there are descriptions also in &quot; Toto Saijiki &quot; written by Gekkin SAITO saying &quot; July 6 , from the dawn of this morning &quot; and in &quot; Kokon Yoranko &quot; written by Hirokata YASHIRO saying &quot; tanabata first appeared in the Engishiki as Shokujo-sai which is held on July 7 &quot; .
many &quot; Tanabata Matsuri &quot; that started after the Second World War at many places were organized following the pattern of Sendai Tanabata .
the practice of tanabata declined after the solar calendar was adopted in 1873 and such trend was further spurred by the economic downturn after the First World War .
under such circumstances , volunteers in shopping avenues worried about the situation and set big tanabata decorations in 1927 .
then , a lot of people visited and the shopping avenue became crowded .
since then , &quot; Tanabata Matsuri &quot; was acknowledged as an event of a shopping avenue which has the ability to attract more customers and has developed as one of city events at present .
Kusudama ( ornamental balls ) used as one of decorations originates from Sendai Tanabata .
different to festivals using mikoshi ( portable shrine ) or dashi ( float ) , the &quot; Tanabata Matsuri &quot; is an event with affinity to shopping avenues .
the reason for the above is because once decorations were prepared on the preceding day , it can pull in shoppers on the target day without impairing the function of the shopping avenue since additional man power and strict traffic restriction is not required on the day of the festival .
since the restoration period after the war , many shopping avenues throughout the nation , especially those in eastern Japan , have organized &quot; Tanabata Matsuri &quot; following the success in Sendai .
up to now , many of them have developed into city events .
among them , a combination of shopping avenue &apos;s event in the daytime and fireworks at night is often seen .
like Matsuzaka Tanabata Matsuri started in 2001 , some cities call their local events , which are not the events of shopping avenue but a combination of stage show and fireworks near the riverside , &quot; Tanabata Matsuri &quot; .
Yuzawa City , Akita Prefecture ( Tanabata Edoro Matsuri &#91; tanabata painted garden lantern festival &#93; ) , a tanabata with a 300 year old tradition with its feature of displaying hundreds of garden lanterns on which Ukiyoe bijin ( beautiful woman ) are painted .

from 2001 , the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan started to call July 7 of the old calendar as &quot; traditional tanabata &quot; and announced the date of the new calendar day that coincides with it on the grounds that stars are often invisible since July 7 of the new calendar falls in the midst of the rainy season .
being a national institute , however , the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan is not allowed to define the day of tanabata based on &quot; the old calendar &quot; since &quot; the old calendar &quot; is not officially used at present .
under such circumstances , it defines &quot; the day of traditional tanabata &quot; as the day which is the nearest to July 7 of the old calendar , &quot; the seventh day after the day of new moon which falls on or before shosho ( the moment when the ecliptic coordinates mark 150 degree ) of 24 sekki ( seasons ) and is nearest to shosho . &quot;
the dates of &quot; traditional tanabata &quot; ( old tanabata ) that were announced by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan are as follows .

the following chart shows the phases of the moon , their respective names and the easiness to view the Milky Way on July 7 of Gregorian calendar for the coming 10 years .
as the brightness of the Milky Way is faint , it is difficult to see it when it &apos;s disturbed by moonlight or light pollution .
a new moon refers to the moon when its phase is 0 , a waxing moon refers to the moon when its phase is 7.5 , a full moon refers to the moon when its phase is 14 and a waning moon refers to the moon when its phase is 22.5 .
the Milky Way is visible for only a limited time around the time of waxing and waning moon and almost invisible around the time of the full moon .

Eiraku-tsuho is a coin minted during the reign of the 3rd emperor of the Ming dynasty , Yongle .
a huge number of the coins were imported into Japan during the Muromachi period and they were called Eiraku-sen and distributed in Japan up to the early Edo period .
the coin was round-shaped which has a square hole at the center , and on the surface were kanji characters &apos; 永樂通寳 &apos; which are read from top to bottom and right to left .
the coins were made of copper and circulated as a value of 1 mon ( a unit name and value of small money at the time ) ; however , in Japan one Eiraku-tsuho coin was valued at 4 mons of Bitasen ( low quality coins with surfaces worn away ) from the Tensho years .
in 1608 , a ban on the circulation of Eiraku-sen was issued and Eiraku-tsuho were replaced with domestically minted coins such as Kanei-tsuho .
however , the virtual monetary unit called Ei ( Ei of Eiraku-tsuho ) remained in place ; i.e. , Ikkanmon ( weight of the coins and approximately equivalent to 1,000 mon of coins ) of Ei equaled 1 ryo ( a unit name for a large sum of money ) of a gold coin , thus 1 Ei was treated as 1 / 1000 ryo .
this Ei account system actually continued to be used for the collection of nengu ( annual tax ) .
thus Eiraku-tsuho greatly influenced the Japanese monetary system over a long period of time ( 1 Ei was actually equivalent to around 4 mon ) .
it is thought that Eiraku-tsuho was not circulated in the territory of the Ming and was mainly used overseas .
in the Ming dynasty during the reign of the founder Emperor Kobu ( Shu GENSHO ) , the use of metal coins was prohibited and all the money were switched to paper money ( later switched again to Ginjo - silver coins used in China until early in the 20th century ) .
( Emperor Kobu also issued Daichu-tsuho &apos; copper coins &apos; in a part of his own territory before he unified China ; after the unification , he issued Kobu-tsuho &apos; copper coins . &apos; )
in the meantime , the money economy in Japan rapidly developed and the demands for Chinese coins greatly increased .
as a result in China , Eiraku-tsuho was minted as an instrument to settle the trade with Japan .
Nobunaga ODA used Eiraku-tsuho as his symbol .
the reason why he used it as his symbol was not known , however , it is said that with foresight he paid attention to the monetary economy .
Eiraku-sen
as commerce and physical distribution was activated from the Heian to the Kamakura period in Japan , the need for money became important .
however , because the Ritsuryo system had already collapsed at the time and the technology to mint coins as well as the office in charge fell into disuse , Japan had to import copper coins from China to distribute domestically .
among them , the copper coin Eiraku-tsuho ( Eiraku-sen ) minted from 1411 in the reign of the Ming dynasty &apos;s Emperor Yongle were imported on a massive scale in the middle of the Muromachi period .
most of them were imported through the tally trade ( between Japan and the Ming dynasty ) to Japan .
the term Eiraku-sen is sometimes applied to all copper coins imported at the time of the Ming dynasty .
the quality of the copper coins was good , and these coins were used as a key currency until the early Edo period .
while privately minted coins are called Shichusen , many shichusen minted in Jiangnan in China and Japan were also circulated .
however , these shichusen were called bitasen for their inferior quality and exchanged at a lower value than government casting Eiraku-sen .
as the difference in the value of the copper coins became a problem , the sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) in the Sengoku period often issued ordinances called Erizenirei , which banned differentiating the good coins and bad coins .
the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) began casting their own copper coins ( called Keicho-tsuho ) in the year 1606 of the Edo period ; two years later , the bakufu issued an ordinance prohibiting the distribution of Eiraku-sen .
it is said that at this stage , the amount of Keicho-tsuho circulated was not sufficient enough , and the ban resulted in prohibiting the circulation of Eiraku-sen at a superior position and promoting the use of Eiraku-sen at the same level as bitasen .
after the Genna-Enbu ( peace after Genna era ) in 1636 , the bakufu minted Kanei-tsuho ( pronounced as kan-ei-tsuho ) in earnest and Eiraku-sen was gradually driven out when the new coins started to circulate in the entire country in and after the Kanbun era ( 1661- 1672 ) .
the Eiraku-tsuho was mainly circulated in the Ise Province and Owari Province and eastward .
particularly in Kanto , Eiraku-tsuho was regarded as the key currency , and in some cases this is called Eidakasei ( currency system based on Eiraku-tsuho ) .
in Western Japan , people preferred using the old coins from the Tang and Northern Sung dynasties such as the Sung currency , and Eiraku-tsuho was not circulated very much until the 16th Century .
Ukiyoe is a genre of the pictorial arts established during the Edo period .
the word &quot; ukiyo &quot; ( this life ) also means &quot; modern , &quot; and Ukiyoe refers to Fuzokuga , in which paintings depicts the manners and customs of the day .
while Ukiyoe is descended from Yamato-e painting ( a traditional Japanese style painting of the late Heian and Kamakura periods dealing with Japanese themes ) , and consistent with the cultural background of the comprehensive pictorial art genre ; by contrast , it depicts scenes from people &apos;s everyday life and things .
generally , when it comes to Ukiyoe today , one is solely reminded of the multicolor woodblock print ( Nishikie &#91; colored woodblock print &#93; ) in many cases , but original drawings ( Nikuhitsu Ukiyoe &#91; single copy paintings created by brush &#93; ) and so on are also included .
Ukiyoe is divided into two categories : the original drawing and the woodblock print .
an original drawing was created as a single piece of work , and drawings of prestigious Eshi painters were expensive , and also the numbers of works were limited .
contrastingly , the woodblock print benefited from the fact that as a print , the same picture could be inexpensively printed off many times , so even the general public of the Edo period was easily able to obtain such works .
the Ukiyoe woodblock print was a part of the popular culture , and prints were adored by being picked up and looked at .
they were not framed and looked at from a distance as we know it today at art exhibitions , etc .
they served as illustrations for Kusazoshi ( Japanese chapter books ) , Emakimono ( illustrated scrolls ) and Kawaraban ( commercial news sheets of the Edo period ) .
picture calendars called Egoyomi , which included works with diverse ideas , such as having hidden numbers in the pictures , were produced .
as homecoming gifts from Edo , Ukiyoe were appreciated due to their beauty and small size .
there was a type used for clipping play , like Omochae ( toy pictures for children ) .
Ukiyoe is , in terms of expressiveness , characterized by clear-cut design , daring patterns , shadowless expression , etc .
perspective was also introduced .
there was a type in which perspective was intentionally ignored , as demonstrated in Hokusai &apos;s &quot; Tsuri no meijin &quot; ( Master of fishing ) , where a figure in the distance is conversely depicted as larger .
Ukiyoe originally appeared as paintings depicting the customs and manners of everyday life , &apos; ukiyo . &apos;
the early stages
from the Great Fire in Meireki to around the Horeki era .
Ukiyoe in the early stages mainly consisted of original drawings and single-color woodblock printing ( Sumizurie &#91; pictures printed in black India ink lines &#93; ) .
there appeared Tan-e and Benie , which colored Sumizurie with red pigment ; there was also Benizurie , in which adding few additional colors , such as green on Benie .
immediately before the appearance of Nishikie , an extremely low-chromatic multicolor printing called Mizue emerged , in which profile lines are drawn by &quot; Tsuyukusa &quot; ( blue Asiatic Dayflower ) rather than India ink .
the middle stages
from 1765 to around 1806 .
a form of bright multicolor printing , Azuma-nishikie ( brocade picture of the East ) was devised , and it brought the Ukiyoe culture into bloom .
the division of labor was beginning to be established among Shitaeshi ( Ukiyoe artists ) , Horishi ( carvers ) and Surishi ( printers ) .
the later stages
from 1807 to around 1858 .
bijinga ( a type of Ukiyoe portraying beautiful women ) , Yakushae ( print of Kabuki actors ) , Mushae ( Ukiyoe prints of warriors ) and Meishoe ( landscape drawings ) , as a result of travel boom , were developed .
the end stages
from 1859 to around 1912 .
from the end of the Edo period to the Meiji period , such Ukiyoe as Yokohama-e ( Yokohama pictures ) , Kaika-e ( enlightenment pictures ) , Nishikie-shinbun ( newspapers ) and so on played an important role in introducing Western things as well as Japanese society .
Muzan-e ( atrocity prints ) and Senso-e ( prints of war , or battle scenes ) , were well received , but Ukiyoe eventually began to decline , losing ground to other media such as newspapers , photographs , etc .
eshi painters changed careers and became illustrators and Japanese-style painters , and the tradition of Ukiyoe came down to other genres .
this refers to the period from the Great Fire in Meireki to around the Horeki era .
Ukiyoe in the early stages were mainly original drawings and single-color woodblock prints ( Sumizurie ) .
after the mid-17th century , a person who made original drawings for woodblock prints was called Hanshita-eshi ( professional draftsman ) , then Moronobu HISHIKAWA , who drew illustrations for picture books and Ukiyo-zoshi ( popular stories of everyday life in the Edo period ) , made his appearance .
the famous &quot; Mikaeri Bijin zu ( Picture of Looking-Back Beauty ) , &quot; his most important work , is an original drawing .
Saikaku &apos;s &quot; Koshoku ichidai otoko ( Life of a Amorous Man ) &quot; ( published in 1682 ) describes that Ukiyoe was drawn on a folding fan with 12 ribs , and this is the oldest literature in which the word &quot; Ukiyoe &quot; can be found .
when the days of Kiyonobu TORII began , there appeared a type of Sumizurie colored with ink brush .
these were colored mainly with red pigments , but one with tan ( red earth ) being used was called Tan-e and the one with beni ( rouge ) used was called Benie .
furthermore , one with a few colors being added to Benie was called Benizurie .
since that time , the Torii school of Ukiyoe has closely been associated with Kabuki ( traditional drama performed by male actors ) and works on Kabuki billboards even today .
this refers to the period from 1765 , when Nishikie ( print ) was born , to around 1806 .
in 1765 , Egoyomi ( picture calendars ) became fashionable , especially among Haiku poets , and Egoyomi exchange parties started to be organized .
to meet the demand , Harunobu SUZUKI and others worked out Azuma-nishikie printed in multiple colors , and the Ukiyoe culture came into full bloom .
as to the factors by which multicolor printing was made possible , it is pointed out that &quot; Kento &quot; ( guide marks ) were introduced to mark the points for overprinting , and that strong , high-quality Japanese papers that withstood multiple-color printing became available .
papers made of Kozo ( paper mulberry ) , such as Echizen-hoshogami ( heavy Japanese paper of the best quality in Echizen Province ) , Iyo-masagami , Nishino-uchigami and so on were used .
also , the economic development took an important role , as the division of labor was established for the complicated processes among Shitaeshi , Horishi and Surishi .
after Harunobu SUZUKI &apos;s death , Bijinga began to change from androgynous , doll-like patterns to realistic ones .
during the Anei era , Shigemasa KITAO enjoyed popularity for his Bijinga .
realistic delineation was also added to Yakushae , and bromide-like Nigaoe ( portraits ) were drawn by Shunsho KATSUKAWA .
furthermore , Utamaro KITAGAWA made his appearance and drew many Okubie ( &quot; large-head &quot; pictures ) , which was a type of Bijinga with a delicate , elegant , gracious touch .
in 1790 , the &apos; Aratame in &apos; approval seal system was established , and various restrictions were enforced for publications .
in 1795 , a Hanmoto ( publisher ) called Juzaburo TSUTAYA , whose assets had been confiscated due to his breaking a ban , introduced Sharaku TOSHUSAI as a revival measure .
though he attracted public attention with his uniquely exaggerated Yakushae , his popularity made a poor showing due to the excessive exaggeration of features , and he was defeated by &quot; Yakusha butai no sugatae &quot; ( likenesses of actors on the stage ) by Toyokuni UTAGAWA , which were overwhelmingly popular .
afterward , the largest school of Ukiyoe Eshi painters , the Utagawa school , consisting of Toyokuni &apos;s disciples began to take shape .
from 1807 to around 1858 .
after Utamaro KITAGAWA &apos;s death , the mainstream of Bijinga turned toward sensual , sexy beauty and loveliness such as Eisen KEISAI drew .
Hokusai KATSUSHIKA , one of Shunsho KATSUKAWA &apos;s disciples , along with the travel boom , drew the &quot; Fugaku sanju rokkei ( Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji ) , &quot; which triggered the publication of the &quot; Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi ( The Fifty-Three Stations of the Tokaido Road ) , &quot; by Hiroshige UTAGAWA .
with these two artists , Meishoe ( landscape drawing ) in the category of Ukiyoe was developed .
in the category of Yakushae , Kunisada UTAGAWA , as the successor to his teacher Toyokuni UTAGAWA , drew strong Yakushae .
in Kusazoshi , Mushae , along with the boom in fantastical tales , came to be drawn by Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA and others .
the &quot; Suikoden &quot; ( The Water Margin ) series of Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA gained popularity at that time , and the &quot; Suikoden boom &quot; took place .
&quot; Edo sunako saisenki &quot; published in 1853 described &quot; Toyokuni Nigao ( Nigaoe ) , Kuniyoshi Musha ( Mushae ) and Hiroshige Meisho ( Meishoe ) . &quot;
from 1859 to around 1912 .
Yokohama-e ( Yokohama Ukiyoe ) became fashionable among people who were inspired by Kurofune ( the &quot; black ships &quot; of Commodore Matthew Perry ) and became interested in Western cultures .
after the Meiji Restoration , Kaika-e ( enlightenment pictures ) , which depict rare Western architecture and railways , replaced Yokohama-e .
while in Japan which was domestically disrupted by the Meiji Restoration , grotesque things appeared in Kabuki and other shows , Yoshiiku OCHIAI and Yoshitoshi TSUKIOKA , who were disciples of Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA , drew &quot; Eimei nijuhachishuku , &quot; which depicted bloody scenes and were called Muzan-e , as well as illustrations for articles in Nishikie-shinbun .
Yoshitoshi TSUKIOKA , with his delicate , sketching-oriented patterns , drew not only Muzan-e but also many Rekishiga ( historical paintings ) and Fuzokuga , and came to be called &quot; The last Ukiyoe artist . &quot;
as he positively encouraged his disciples to learn about other categories of the pictorial art , many disciples achieved greatness as illustrators and Japanese-style painters , such as Kiyokata KABURAKI ; thus the tradition of Ukiyoe came down to other genres .
also , some artists of the Kano school , including Kyosai KAWANABE , started drawing Ukiyoe .
Kiyochika KOBAYASHI created new landscape drawings called Kosenga in which profile lines weren &apos;t used .
Yoshifuji UTAGAWA applied Ukiyoe on Omochae , which is now called paper appendices , and , due to the popularity of the idea , played an active role as an Eshi painter specializing in Omochae .
he was even called the &quot; Omocha Yoshifuji . &quot;
Ukiyoe gradually declined , losing ground to newspapers , photographs , new technologies such as lithographs , etc .
Ukiyoe artists exercised their ingenuity against photographs , mostly in vain , and were forced to become illustrators and so on .
the history of Ukiyoe , which was handed down from the Edo period , nearly ended with the Sensou-e depicting the Sino-Japanese War as the last one .
from the Taisho period to the Showa period , Hasui KAWASE and others intended to restore Ukiyoe with new woodblock prints , and left behind many works that utilized the woodblock multicolor printing technique of Ukiyoe .
Jihon toiya , publishers and sellers that dealt with entertaining publications , became publishers of Ukiyoe .
at that time , townspeople weren &apos;t permitted to adopt surnames and wear swords ; thus , TSURUYA and so on weren &apos;t surnames but Yago ( the name of the store ) .
Kiemon TSURUYA ( TSURUYA )
one of the long-established stores .
he published the first part of &quot; Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi . &quot;

however , even after caricatures and Yakushae were banned , it published Yakushae as &quot; scribbling . &quot;
it dealt with many Uchiwae ( pictures on fans ) , currently it runs a fan , folding fan and calendar business in Nihonbashi ( Chuo Ward Tokyo ) and has branch stores at Isetan Shinjuku Store , Nihonbashi MITSUKOSHI , GINZA ITO-YA and so on .

&quot; Tokaido fukeizue &quot; ( Hiroshige UTAGAWA ; description : shuin YANAGISHITA )
landscapes , portraits of kabuki actors , Sumo wrestlers and Yujo ( prostitutes ) were depicted .
many fall under the category of present-day comics and contain elements of caricature .
traditional themes , which were to be materials for Chinese paintings and Yamato-e paintings , were sometimes transformed for Ukiyoe .
as for Shunga ( erotic arts ) depicting love scenes , most well-known Eshi painters drew them .
shunga were often sold in package deals .
because their selling prices were high , much money was allowed to be used for production and high-level production techniques were employed .
having the element of mocking ( lampooning ) the real sex culture , they weren &apos;t necessarily sensational , and it has been indicated that they shouldn &apos;t be regarded merely as pornography .
bijinga : pictures depicting young women .
Kanban-musume ( poster girls ) and Yujo , who were popular at that time , were depicted .
Yakushae : pictures depicting popular Kabuki actors and so on .
some were like bromides , and some served as chirashi ( leaflets ) .
caricature : pictures comically drawn .
tobae was included .
humorous scenes and personifications appeared .
they contained elements of caricature but consistently emphasized the entertainment aspect .
tobae : caricatures depicting long-limbed human characters .
it was derived from the name of Toba Sojo ( high priest ) .
early-stage comics are sometimes referred to in this way .
comics : etehon ( art manuals ) .
pictures depicting all creation .
they were different from the present-day comics .
Hokusai Manga ( Hokusai &apos;s sketches ) were representative examples .
shunga : pictures depicting sex scenes and other sensuous things .
there were brochures for sex toys and personified genital organ and so on .
they were so prevalent in the countryside that Nishikie virtually meant shunga .
it could be a part of a dowry .
Meishoe Landscape drawings
pictures allowed common people of the period , who were unable to travel freely , to see their longed-for famous sights .
they also served as travel brochures .
Mushae : warriors , who had appeared in legends , fantastic tales and history , were depicted .
they became fashionable , particularly with the boom in fantastical tales .
it was prohibited by the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) to depict Nobunaga ODA and warriors after him .
Rekishiga : they depicted historically famous scenes .
after the Meiji Restoration , there were works that depicted the past emperors in order to promote the legitimacy of the imperial family .
Omochae : there were works to be pasted on Sugoroku ( Japanese backgammon ) and Menko ( Japanese-style pogs ) , miniatures of popular Ukiyoe , paper fashion dolls , works called Zukushie on which many specters and warriors were gathered , and so on .
many ideas were adopted for use in children &apos;s toys .
mitate-e : parodies of classical works .
Sumoue : pictures depicting Sumo .
among them were bromides of performing Sumo wrestlers at the time .
Harimaze-e : works on which several pictures were drawn on a single sheet of paper .
Shinie : woodblock prints issued as the deaths of celebrities .
some were for famous Eshi painters .
Kodomoe : pictures depicting children at play .
Nagasakie : pictures depicting the foreign cultures that were seen in Nagasaki .
Yokohama-e : pictures full of the exotic atmosphere of Yokohama .
Namazue : pictures that appeared after the Ansei Great Earthquakes .
it was derived from the popular superstition that Namazu ( catfish ) bring on earthquakes .
Hoso-e : charms to avert smallpox .
Uchiwae : pictures to be pasted on fans .
persons who drew Ukiyoe were called Ukiyoe artists or Eshi painters ( Edakumi &#91; a painter &#93; ) .
persons who carved the pictures drawn by Ukiyoe artists in woodblocks were Horishi ( Choko &#91; carvers &#93; ) , and persons who colored the woodblocks and printed were Surishi ( printers ) .
although Ukiyoe were collaborative works , customarily only the names of Eshi painters were remembered .
at least four parties , including an additional party as the purchaser , became necessary .
&quot; kento &quot; ( present-day registration marks &#91; printing &#93; ) were attached in order to check the position of the paper and prevent misalignment of the colors in multicolor printing .
some have theorized that it was worked out by a wholesale dealer for publication , Kichiemon UEMURA , in 1744 , but others have asserted that it was practiced by a surishi named Kinroku in 1765 .
it is also said that it was invented by Gennai HIRAGA , who associated with Harunobu SUZUKI ..
the phrases such as &quot; Kento wo tsukeru &quot; ( to take aim at ) , &quot; Kento chigai &quot; ( off the mark ) , &quot; Kentou hazure &quot; ( out of register ) , which are used even today , derive from this &quot; Kento . &quot;
the dyestuffs and pigments used for Ukiyoe woodblock prints were relatively inexpensive plant-derived and mineral ones .
black was India ink .
early-stage works printed in a single color with India ink were referred to as &quot; Sumizurie . &quot;
white ( Gofun ) is made from ground clamshell ( calcium carbonate ) .
in reddish colors
Benie
vermilion : mercury
Bengal red : iron oxide
tan ( red lead ) : lead
in yellowish colors
yellow : turmeric , aroma tree , Garcinia cambogia tree
Orpiment ( arsenious sulfide , 生黄 ) : 硫化黄 ( arsenic sulfide )
in bluish colors
indigo : indigo plant ( plant ) , blue Asiatic dayflower
and so on , while neutral colors such as purple were expressed through mixtures of these primary colors .
additionally , gold , silver and mica powder were used to obtain a luxurious look .
works on which mica powder was used for a plain background were called &quot; Kirazuri . &quot;
they were so vulnerable to color fading that works which retain the colors at the time of printing are rare .
the Spaulding Collection ( approximately 6,500 items ) of Boston &apos;s Museum of Fine Arts remains private in principle , respecting the intent of the Spaulding brothers , who donated their collection on the condition of &quot; no exhibition permitted &quot; ( viewing digital images is possible ) .
from the end of the Edo period to the Meiji period , bright foreign-made pigments became available ; these characterized the Nishikie during that period .
Aizuri , Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji ( Fugaku sanju rokkei ) , etc .
purple : Murako
pink : Rhodamine
red : Aniline red ( cochineal ) - Kaikae , etc .
in the Meiji period or later , Ukiyoe received little attention in Japan , and many of the works were taken out of the country .
consequently , no legitimate , systematic and academic study could be conducted for Ukiyoe as a pictorial art work , and opinions based on different knowledge sources were partially and continually repeated only by individual collectors and researchers .
moreover , as it happens , there are counterfeits of many famous works , including those of Harunobu SUZUKI , Utamaro KITAGAWA and others distributed from the time of Edo period .
on the other hand , in Western countries Ukiyoe were found and highly appreciated by the great masters of the Impressionist school , whose works were influenced by Ukiyoe , and they were even reproduced in oil paintings .
apparently , at least 200,000 or more items of Ukiyoe are kept in storage in 20 or more of the most prestigious Western museums ; moreover , various individuals have private collections , thus indicating that Ukiyoe is the only foreign art form that is collected in such great numbers .
many museums keep 10,000 or more items of Ukiyoe , such as Boston &apos;s Museum of Fine Arts with 50,000 items , the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts with 30,000 items , and so on .
Ukiyoe is the world &apos;s only vivid-colored woodblock prints ; Western pictorial art has no such category , which is thought to encourage its appreciation .
among the many Ukiyoe that have been scattered , works of comparatively simple patterns , including Utamaro , were large in number while Ukiyoe of richly colored ( gaudy ) complex patterns were unexpectedly small in number .
as Ukiyoe remain domestically in multiples of those that have been scattered overseas , it is hoped that studies will further proceed for Ukiyoe as a rare art work in the world , so that appreciation of the form isn &apos;t limited to the West .
it is also valuable that Ukiyoe is the only material in the world that depicts the varied lives of ordinary people in the Medieval period .
according to the documents of the Meiji period , there were close to 2,000 Eshi painters until that time , if unknown Eshi painters are included .
because 100 to 200 pieces were printed for a work at that time , huge numbers of Ukiyoe appeared in the cities and , unlike anywhere else in the world , high-quality works of art were very popular among ordinary people .
while Ukiyoe influenced Japonism , it received influence from overseas .
synthetic pigment , Prussian blue ( &quot; Bero &quot; came from Berlin ) , which originated from Germany , produced bright color and was used by Hokusai KATSUSHIKA and others .
the Western perspective and shading technique were also adopted .
in 1865 , the French painter Bracquemond showed his friends &quot; Hokusai Manga , &quot; which were on the wrapping papers of earthenware goods , and ultimately this had a great influence on the Impressionists .
this brought about the situation in Europe that Ukiyoe pieces were traded at high prices that were unthinkable in Japan at the time , while in Japan Ukiyoe were for ordinary people &apos;s entertainment and secondhand and defective ones were traded at prices so low that they were used as packaging material for sea cargoes .
it is well known that Vincent VAN GOGH drew Ukiyoe on the background of his work entitled &quot; Portrait of Pere Tanguy &quot; and reproduced Hiroshige &apos;s works in his oil painting , while the &quot; Young Flautist &quot; of Edouard MANET was influenced by Ukiyoe .
furthermore , some planar designs similar to Ukiyoe are found in Art Nouveau due to the influences of Japonism and Bing , who dealt with Japanese arts .
Ukiyoe even influenced classical music , as Claude DEBUSSY was inspired by Hokusai &apos;s &quot; Kanagawa oki nami ura ( Behind the Great Wave at Kanagawa ) &quot; and composed &quot; La Mer ( The Sea ) &quot; ( the print was used on the front cover of the full score published in 1905 , and there is a photograph in which the print can be identified as an ornament in a study ) .
Karatedo ( also known as karate ) , a martial art and a combat sport developed in Okinawa , is characterized as a striking art that uses kicking .
during the Taisho period , karate at first spread from Okinawa Prefecture to other prefectures and then to overseas countries after WWII .
today , karate is loved as a martial art , combat sport and sport with worldwide popularity .
the currently prevailing karate can be divided into two categories based on the differences in match rules : &quot; dentoha karate &quot; ( traditional-style karate ) , which adopts the &quot; sundome &quot; ( non-contact ) rules , and full-contact karate , which adopts direct-attack rules .
there is also &quot; bogutsuki karate &quot; ( included in the full-contact karate in a broad sense ) , in which practitioners wear protective gear when practicing karate .
the modern karate is a combat sport characterized mainly by a striking art , but the traditional Okinawan karate embraced grappling techniques called &apos; toitee , or torite , &apos; as well as throwing techniques .
also , at one time the exercise of &quot; buki jutsu &quot; ( the art of weapons ) , together with karate , such as &quot; bo-jutsu , &quot; ( the art of using a stick as a weapon ) &quot; sai-jutsu , &quot; ( the art of using traditional Okinawan weapon ) and &quot; nunchaku-jutsu &quot; ( a traditional martial art with two linked fighting sticks ) , was long a general practice .
recently , karate has also seen the rise of circles that aspire to a return to comprehensive &quot; taijutsu &quot; ( a method of using the body for self-defense ) by incorporating skills adopted by other martial arts to compensate for lost karate techniques , as well as circles that promote karate &apos;s development into a new , comprehensive martial art ( a mixed martial art ) .
traditionally , in the main island of Okinawa during the Ryukyu Kingdom era , karate was called &apos; te &apos; ( &apos; tee &apos; in Ryukyu dialect ) or &apos; toude &apos; ( &apos; toudee &apos; in Ryukyu dialect ) .
it is said that the word &apos; te &apos; referred to &quot; kenpo &quot; ( martial art ) peculiar to Okinawa , whereas the word &apos; toude &apos; referred to kenpo , which had come from China .
however , beginning in around 1901 , when schools and colleges in Okinawa adopted karate as a subject of gymnastics classes , the pronunciation was changed from &apos; toudee &apos; to &apos; karate , &apos; and karate came to represent Ryukyu kenpo in general , including &apos; te . &apos;
note that the meanings of &apos; toudee &apos; ( 唐手 ) and &apos; karate &apos; ( 唐手 ) are different .
in Okinawa , Chomo HANASHIRO used the word karate ( 空手 ) for the first time in 1905 , by which he meant &quot; karate kuken &quot; ( a martial art with bare hands , or an unarmed martial art ) .
in the Japanese mainland , a &apos; karate &apos; ( 唐手 ) club at Keio University ( under Master Gichin FUNAKOSHI ) used the word &apos; karate &apos; ( 空手 ) for the first time in 1929 based on the philosophy of &quot; ku &quot; ( 空 ) ( tentative self , ephemeral life ) as espoused by Hannya Shingyo ( Heart Sutra ) , and subsequently this usage spread .
on October 25 , 1936 , it was decided at the meeting &apos; Roundtable Discussion by Karate Masters &apos; ( hosted by Ryukyushinpo ) that &apos; karate &apos; ( 唐手 ) would be changed to &apos; karate &apos; ( 空手 ) .
until the 1960s , it wasn &apos;t unusual that people would use the word &apos; karate &apos; ( 唐手 ) , but today the word &apos; karate &apos; ( 空手 ) has taken root and become common usage .
also , since the 1970s the katakana word &apos; カラテ &apos; ( karate ) and Romanized word &apos; KARATE &apos; have often been used , mainly by organizations of full-contact karate .
in this article , the word &apos; karate &apos; ( 空手 ) is used as the standardized word .
karate as a martial art originated during the Ryukyu Kingdom era , but so far no contemporary documents containing records of karate have been found .
therefore , the history of karate , as discussed here , is based mainly on the lore that old karate experts of the Meiji period had heard from their precursors .
there are many beliefs regarding the origin of karate , but the following are the most significant :
introduced by the 36 Families of Kume &apos; theory
it is said that in 1392 , in the era of the Ming Dynasty , a professional group called the &apos; 36 Min families &apos; immigrated from Fusian Province to the village of Kuninda in Naha City .
they introduced advanced arts , science and technologies to the Ryukyu Kingdom , and according to this theory Chinese martial arts , from which karate originated , were introduced at the same time .
developed from country mekata &apos; theory
mekata , a word from the Okinawa dialect , refers to &apos; dance . &apos;
this theory asserts that a country-style Ryukyu dance having an element of a martial art developed into &apos; tee , &apos; a martial art peculiar to Okinawa , which in turn developed into karate .
this theory was espoused by Anko AZATO and his pupil , Gichin FUNAKOSHI .
others include a belief that karate was developed from &quot; Shima &quot; ( Okinawan sumo ) and a belief that &quot; jujutsu &quot; ( a classical Japanese martial art , usually referring to fighting without a weapon ) of the Japanese mainland was introduced .
all these theories were proposed after the Meiji period by karate experts and researchers , but none of them is supported by specific historical documents .
it was in the days of Kanga SAKUKAWA ( 1782-1838 ) , nicknamed as Toudee SAKUKAWA , that the word &apos; toudee &apos; first appeared in Okinawan history .
in 1806 , Sakukawa , then 28 years old , went to study in China &apos;s Qing Dynasty and allegedly learned Chinese martial arts in Beijing .
it is considered that toudee , the root of today &apos;s karate , was the amalgamation of Chinese martial arts , which Sakukawa brought back to Okinawa &apos;s main island , into the traditional Okinawan martial art &apos; tee . &apos;
after the days of Sakukawa , tee , while merging and assimilating into toudee , is considered to have ebbed away .
generally , the differences between toudee and tee seem to have blurred in discussions concerning the history of karate .
therefore , karate in a more limited sense dates from Sakukawa ( more strictly speaking , however , Sakukawa was merely a master of toudee , or Chinese martial arts ; when discussing the origin of karate as an art of Japan &apos;s martial skills , it has to wait until the era after Sokon MATSUMURA , a pupil of Sakukawa ) , but of course the history of karate as an Okinawan martial art as a whole , including tee , dates from periods prior to Sakukawa .
we will discuss the history of karate in a broader sense below .
traditionally , the kinmu seisaku ( a ban on weapons ) , which was implemented twice , has been cited as the reason that karate prospered in Okinawa &apos;s main island during the Ryukyu Kingdom era .
the first kinmu seisaku was implemented during the time of King Sho Shin ( who reigned from 1476 to 1526 ) , whereby weapons across the nation were collected and strictly controlled by the Kingdom .
the second kinmu seisaku was implemented after the invasion of the Ryukyu Kingdom by the Satsuma Domain ( Shimazu Clan ) in 1609 .
traditionally , the belief that Okinawan people , who were deprived of weapons after two kinmu seisaku , tried to refine karate to confront the Satsuma Domain was repeatedly insisted as if it were a historical fact .
recently , however , many researchers have questioned the correlation between the kinmu seisaku and the development of karate .
particularly , it is revealed that the kinmu seisaku by the Satsuma Domain ( which came into effect in 1613 through a written notice to the Ryukyu Kingdom ) was a relatively loose regulation , whereby the carriage of weapons such as swords was banned but ownership of weapons was not .
the first article of the notice was a ban on the ownership of guns .
the second article acknowledged the private ownership of weapons by princes , sanshikan ( the council of three ministers ) and people belonging to the warrior class .
the third article required the repair of weapons to be done in Satsuma Province through zaiban bugyosho ( the place of a magistrate in Ryukyu ) .
the fourth article required the ownership of swords , etc . , to be reported to and certified by zaiban bugyosho .
as can be seen above , they didn &apos;t ban the ownership of weapons ( except guns ) or the practice of weapons .
actually , even after the invasion by the Satsuma Domain many famous masters specializing in Ryukyu-style swordsmanship , spear skills and archery are identified .
also , some critics point out that the idea that an unarmed person counterattacks weapons such as guns and swords is unrealistic in the first place , and that it is unlikely that the warrior class in the Ryukyu Kingdom practiced karate based on such an unrealistic reason .
the theory that karate developed due to the kinmu seisaku is therefore refuted by some researchers as &apos; completely groundless fiction invented in the streets &apos; ( Ryozo FUJIWARA ) .
the &quot; Kyuyo &quot; ( the chronicles of Ryukyu ) introduces an episode in which , during the sixteenth century , when Jikki KYOAHAGON was assaulted by an assassin he kicked the assassin in the groin through an art of &apos; kushu &apos; ( 空手 ) , which is considered to be an unarmed ( bare hands ) martial art prior to toudee , although there is no clear depiction of such an art .
also , the names of a handful of seventeenth-century martial artists have been passed on by word of mouth , but there are no clear descriptions of what kinds of martial arts they practiced .
it was during the eighteenth century that the names of many specific martial artists were clearly identified as practitioners of tee .
they include Master Nishihira , Master Gushikawa , Michinobu SORYO , Shinunjo TOKASHIKI , Yomasa AOI and Choken MAKABE .
also , it is known that &quot; Oshima Hikki &quot; ( the notes of Oshima , 1776 ) , which Yoshiteru TOBE , a Confucian scholar at Tosa Province , wrote based on interviews with Ryukyu warriors who had been washed up to Tosa , reads that Koshokun , a Chinese martial artist , showcased the techniques of the martial art called &apos; kumiai-jutsu &apos; when visiting the Ryukyu Kingdom in the previous year .
it is considered that Koshokun was a military attaché to the Chinese palace who visited the Ryukyu Kingdom as one of the Sakuho Shisetsu ( entourage of Chinese diplomats for the creation of peerage ) in 1756 , and there is a theory that the beginning of karate can be traced to this visit by Koshokun to the Ryukyu Kingdom .
however , another theory suggests that kumiai-jutsu wasn &apos;t a striking art like karate but a type of jujutsu ( a grappling and throwing art ) , and the picture of kumiai-jutsu remains a matter of speculation .
the name &apos; toudee &apos; came into use in the nineteenth century .
however , the differences between toudee and &apos; tee &apos; have become blurred .
it is said that until the beginning of the Meiji period &apos; tee , &apos; which had existed prior to toudee , was called &apos; Okinawa-te &apos; or &apos; uchina-dee , &apos; and that it was distinguished from toudee , but it isn &apos;t known what differentiated the former from the latter .
the following were famous toudee practitioners after the nineteenth century : in Shuri City , Kanga SAKUKAWA and his pupil Sokon MATSUMURA , Master Morishima , and Yamashiro ABURAYA ; in Tomari City , Taka UKUYOSHI and Zo TERUYAKI ; in Naha City , Isei KOGUSUI and 長浜筑登之親雲上 .
particularly , Shokon MATSUMURA , also known as &apos; Ryukyu &apos;s Musashi MIYAMOTO ( a famous swordsman ) , &apos; is said to have been the greatest karate artist in the era of the Ryukyu Kingdom .
he worked as a military attaché to the King of Ryukyu and allegedly served as the king &apos;s martial-arts coach .
around the same time , traditional Japanese martial arts , which were introduced to Okinawa via Satsuma Province , allegedly influenced the development of toudee .
in the late Ryukyu Kingdom era , some of the Ryukyu warriors learned swordsmanship , such as the Jigenryu line and its offshoots , from Satsuma officers staying in Ryukyu , and some of them , like Sokon MATSUMURA , migrated to Satsuma Province to master the Jigenryu line .
the karate technique &apos; makiwara tsuki &apos; ( punching the punching board ) is said to have been modeled on the &apos; tachiki-uchi , &apos; ( hitting a hard wood stick to train for attack power ) , a technique adopted by the Jigenryu line .
also , there is a belief that the concept &apos; killing with one thrashing &apos; espoused by karate was fostered under the influence of the Jigenryu line .
by the way , karate circles and organizations did not appear until the end of the Taisho period , when karate was introduced to the Japanese mainland .
previously , karate was merely divided into three loose groups by areas in which karate was popular : Shuri-te , Tomari-te and Naha-te .
this grouping , however , shouldn &apos;t be taken seriously because there were cases in which Shuri warriors learned Shuri-te , Tomari-te and Naha-te simultaneously .
traditionally , toudee was passed down in secret among the warrior class of the Ryukyu Kingdom , but upon the disappearance of the Kingdom based on the overthrow of the Ryukyu royal family in 1879 , toudee too was in danger of disappearing .
except for a handful of affluent families , the warrior class of the Ryukyu Kingdom , a champion of toudee , soon went into ruin , leaving them no room for the practice of toudee .
certain discontented warriors fled to China of the Qing Dynasty ( diasporas to Qing ) , and some of them led independence campaigns there .
the Civilization Party ( reformists ) and the Resolute Party ( conservatives ) cut each other &apos;s throats , shaking the foundation of the warrior class .
it was Anko ITOSU who saved toudee from this critical situation .
based on Itosu &apos;s efforts , toudee was initially adopted as a subject of gymnastics classes at Shuri jinjo Elementary School in 1901 and then at Okinawa Kenritsu Dai-Ichi Middle School ( presently Shuri Senior High School ) and the Normal School ( college of education ) of Okinawa in 1905 .
on this occasion , the pronunciation was changed from &apos; toudee &apos; to &apos; karate . &apos;
toudee survived the danger of disappearance through Itosu &apos;s introduction to the general public and through the adoption of characteristics that were more similar to sports than to martial arts .
ITOSU &apos;s passion for reforms also extended to the creation and refinement of &quot; kata &quot; ( the standard form of movement , posture , etc . , in martial arts , sports , etc . ) .
for example , he created the kata called &apos; binan &apos; ( the form of peace ) for children and students to ensure easier learning while getting rid of dangerous techniques such as attacks to vulnerable body parts and the breaking of joints due to the existing kata .
apart from this movement , some Okinawans who went to China opened a toudee training hall in China , while others learned Chinese martial arts there and brought them back to Okinawa .
examples of the latter are Isei KOGUSUKU , Kanryo HIGAONNA and Kanmon KAMICHI .
some modern researchers , however , have begun to cast doubt on the introduction of Chinese martial arts by the latter group , as it has become widely known , due to the dissemination of books and videos about Chinese martial arts , that the martial arts they introduced to Okinawa don &apos;t resemble Chinese martial arts very much , and because prototype Chinese martial arts weren &apos;t identified despite several dispatches of investigative teams from Japan to China after the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries .
according to the latest studies , it is said that karate was first introduced to the Japanese mainland during the Meiji period by former Ryukyu warriors who boarded at the Tokyo residence of Tai Sho , the Marques of Okinawa .
they , upon invitation , gave a karate demonstration at the residences of other domains , or taught the techniques of striking and kicking arts at training halls of the Yoshin-ryu school or the Kito-ryu school , or on the streets .
however , full-fledged karate education developed after the Taisho period , when Gichin FUNAKOSHI and Choki MOTOBU migrated to the Japanese mainland .
at the First Gymnastics Exhibition in May 1922 , which was hosted by the Ministry of Education , Funakoshi gave a karate demonstration .
this was the first public exhibition of karate in the Japanese mainland .
this demonstration drew great attention from martial artists in the mainland , such as Jigoro KANO , a judo expert .
the following June , Funakoshi was invited to the Kodokan Judo Institute , where he gave a karate demonstration and explanatory session to more than 200 black-belt judo experts , including Jigoro KANO .
FUNAKOSHI then settled in Tokyo and taught karate there .
at about the same time , Choki MOTOBU stole the show in the Kansai area by showcasing his karate skills before the public .
in November 1922 , during a leisurely visit to Kyoto , Motobu happened to notice a fight show between experts in judo and boxing and appeared in the show without prior application , and with one thrashing he defeated his challenger , as Russian boxer .
he was 52 years old at that time .
this incident made the headlines in newspapers and magazines , and it is said that karate , which had been known only to some of the martial artists , became known nationwide overnight .
the following year , Motobu began to teach karate in the Kansai area .
inspired by the actions of Funakoshi and Motobu , university students set up karate clubs at their universities , one after another .
in Okinawa , the Karate Study Club was set up in 1924 and developed into the Okinawa Karate Club in 1926 , whereby karate grand masters in Okinawa gathered together to promote the exchange of karate techniques and carry out collaborative research on karate on a trial basis .
many karate superstars were among the participants , such as Chomo HANASHIRO , Choyu MOTOBU , Choki MOTOBU , Chotoku KYAN , Chosin CHIBANA , Kenwa MABUNI , Chojun MIYAGI , Juhatsu KYODA and Kenki GO .
in the early Showa period , Kenwa MABUNI , Chojun MIYAGI and Kanken TOYAMA migrated to the Japanese mainland and taught karate there .
in 1933 , karate was acknowledged by the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai ( Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ) as one of the Japanese martial arts .
this was a revolutionary event since karate , which had developed in a small region like Okinawa , was certified as a Japanese martial art , but at the same its significance was tainted by the fact that karate was categorized as one variety of judo / jujutsu and by the humiliating condition that karate ranks and titles should be judged by judo experts .
in 1929 , a karate club at Keio University , where Gichin FUNAKOSHI taught as a grand master , announced that the Chinese spelling of karate would be changed to &apos; 空手 &apos; based on the philosophy of &apos; ku ( 空 ) ( tentative self , ephemeral life ) &apos; espoused by Hannya Shingyo ( Heart Sutra ) , and this spelling was authorized by the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai in 1934 .
also , it was decided that the suffix &apos; -do , &apos; which was adopted by other Japanese martial arts , would be added to karate , with &apos; karate-jutsu &apos; being changed to &apos; karate-do . &apos;
it is said that behind those reforms there was also a willingness among karate practitioners to pander to the militaristic climate of the time ( the former Chinese spelling of karate &apos; 唐手 &apos; could be associated with China ) .
incidentally , it has been discovered that Chomo HANASHIRO began using the word &apos; 空手 &apos; in 1905 .
karate , in the Japanese mainland , concentrated on a striking art by getting rid of the techniques called &apos; toutee , &apos; which had characteristics similar to jujutsu , so as to differentiate karate from judo , partly because karate was classified as a variety of judo by the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai .
at the same time , supplementary arts of weapons , such as bo-jutsu and nunchaku-jutsu , were abandoned .
some karate circles made alterations to the posture and movement of kata or embraced Japanese-style names for kata .
additionally , new types of kumite ( paired karate kata ) were created by karate practitioners in the Japanese mainland , because Okinawan traditional kumite weren &apos;t fully introduced , resulting in the birth of modern karatedo .
as for the evaluation of these reforms , some acknowledge that reforms contributed to the popularization of karate in the Japanese mainland but others criticize that reforms resulted in deviation from the traditional way of karate .
during the period of allied nations &apos; occupation , the activities of karate grew stagnant temporarily because of the &apos; Notice of Ban on Martial Arts such as Judo and Kendo &apos; issued by the Ministry of Education under the orders of the General Headquarters ( GHQ ) .
however , because the word &apos; karate &apos; wasn &apos;t printed in this notice , the MOE was persuaded to announce that karate wasn &apos;t banned , and karate was able to resume its activities earlier than other martial arts .
although attempts to introduce karate tournaments ( matches ) were pursued before WWII , an organizational effort to promote tournaments wasn &apos;t achieved because some karate experts rejected the idea of a tournament .
however , in 1954 Kanbukan ( presently the All Japan Karatedo Federation Renbukai ) hosted the first National Karatedo Tournament under the &quot; bougtsuki karate &quot; ( karate with protective gear ) rules , followed by the first All Japan Student Karatedo Championships ( under the traditional-style ( sundome ) rules ) in 1957 , which was hosted by the All Japan Student Karatedo Federation established in 1950 .
in 1957 , the Japan Karate Association hosted the National Karatedo Championships .
in 1962 , the karate expert Tatsuo YAMADA hosted the first Karate Competition at Korakuen Hall , whereby karate practitioners with gloves fought games under direct-attack rules , ahead of the ensuing full-contact karate .
in 1964 , the Japan Karatedo Federation ( JKF ) was established .
in September 1969 , the first All Japan Charted Contest , hosted by the JKF , was held at the Nippon Budokan under the traditional-style ( sundome ) rules .
that same month , Masutatsu OYAMA , the founder of Kyokushin Kaikan , who , having become skeptical of traditional-style karate , was pursuing the realization of karate tournaments under direct-attack rules based on his own philosophy , generated a great buzz throughout the karate realm by hosting the first Open Tournament All Japan Karatedo Championships at Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium in Yoyogi , whereby contestants , who were prohibited from wearing any protective gear , fought with bare hands and bare feet under direct-attack rules ( attacks to the face were prohibited , except with kicking ) .
the JKF , meanwhile , hosted the first International Karatedo Championships the following year .
as can be seen above , karate steadily developed on the national and organizational levels .
on the other hand , since joining the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai , karate--traditionally , karate is said to have no schools and circles--saw an increase in the number of organizations ( schools ) and circles .
in 1948 , the Japan Karate Association ( Shotokan-ryu school ) , the largest organization , was set up in Tokyo by pupils of Gichin FUNAKOSHI and was upgraded to a legal entity on April 10 , 1957 by the Ministry of Education .
in 1958 , Motonobu HIRONISHI and others , who were opposed to karate tournaments , reconstructed the Shotokai school , which had existed prior to WWII , and parted company with the JAS .
other organizations and circles experienced similar schisms and fragmentations .
some karate experts such as Kanken TOYAMA espoused the philosophy of karate with no affiliation , but they failed to become the mainstream .
also , backed by practitioners who were dissatisfied with the JKF &apos;s so-called &apos; sundome ( kime ) &apos; match rules , there emerged organizations and circles that advocated full-contact karate--as represented by the Kyokushin Kaikan founded by Masutatsu OYAMA--which was characterized by a direct-attack style ( attacks to the face were prohibited ) , and these organizations came to have power in the karate realm .
however , the Kyokushin Kaikan , which was known for its bond of solidarity when Masutatsu OYAMA was alive , split into several factions , which called themselves &apos; Kyokushin , &apos; and after the death of OYAMA many members left the organization and set up their own circles .
also , as represented by Daido Juku Kudo ( derived from the Kyokushin Kaikan ) , there emerged organizations and circles that , while serving as the antithesis of the modern karate that concentrates on the striking art , sought the return to a comprehensive martial art like the traditional Okinawan karate , by incorporating grappling and throwing techniques into karate .
kata and kumite are basic components of karate , and since early times it has been the standard practice to exercise both skills .
as for which one is more important than the other , opinions have changed with the times .
previously , the practice of kata was valued most , but recently there has been a growing trend toward kumite due to the introduction of tournaments .
against this backdrop , divergence between the former and the latter has become a problem .
kata
kata refers to karate &apos;s solo practice and demonstration style .
in kata , practitioners exercise or demonstrate various techniques in a particular sequence , with the duration of each kata varying from several seconds to several minutes .
it is said that through kata practitioners do not just master karate &apos;s basic skills and posture , but also acquire the body movements peculiar to karate--which is a prerequisite for the practical application of karate--such as kumite .
there were originally several dozen kata ; however , some of them disappeared , and some were invented after the Meiji period ( e.g. binan ) .
the patterns of kata that practitioners learn differ depending on Shuri-te , Tomari-te and Naha-te , or among organizations and circles .
also , there are differences in the same kata depending on the organization and circle , or between Okinawa and the Japanese mainland .
examples of kata adopted by Shuri-te are naifanchi , bassai , kusanku and so on .
examples of kata adopted by Tomari-te are naifanchi ( ancient-style ) , wanshu , rohai and so on .
examples of kata adopted by Naha-te are sanchin , seisan , seishu , super-rinpei and so on .
today , tournaments for kata are also held , and the practice and demonstration of kata itself has become a game .
as kata is applied to tournaments , it is expected that the completion degree of kata will be improved .
kumite
kumite refers to the face-to-face karate practice style ( sparring ) , mainly done as a duo .
history
the oldest authorized , preserved kumite is the 12-set prearranged kumite , which was presented by Choki MOTOBU during the Taisho period ; no kumite prior to this one has preserved , although kumite have been practiced since the era of the Ryukyu Kingdom .
there is a description that a kumite called &apos; ko-shu &apos; was demonstrated in front of an ambassador from the Qing Dynasty who had visited Okinawa to create King Sho Tai as a new rank , but it isn &apos;t known what the &apos; ko-shu &apos; was .
before WWII , except for a handful of cases such as Choki MOTOBU ( see above ) and Kentsu YABU , the main menu of karate lessons was the practice of kata , and kumite was used only to analyze kata for quick review .
as for freestyle kumite , only a sort of street fighting called &apos; kake-dameshi &apos; ( test of strength ) existed .
incidentally , the yakusoku ( prearranged ) kumite practiced today have been created mainly by students in the Japanese mainland since the Showa period .
as for kumite match , its history is short ; kumite matches were fully developed after WWII .
styles
the match style called &apos; sundome , &apos; or &apos; kime , &apos; is one in which the contestants , as a general rule , should stop a punch before it hits the opponent &apos;s body deeper than his / her skin to prevent injury .
this style is adopted mainly by traditional-style karate organizations and circles that are affiliated with the JKF .
in some matches , players are required to wear protective gear , but direct attack isn &apos;t allowed .
however , in many matches , including those hosted by the JKF , contestants are virtually allowed to punch the opponent &apos;s body , whereas they should try to limit any damage by quickly withdrawing the punch ( called &apos; hikite &apos; ) .
this is not compatible with the concepts stated by rules , but it is winked at .
on such occasions it &apos;s common practice that the referee won &apos;t acknowledge that a contestant &apos; hits &apos; ( punches ) the opponent until the opponent has become so damaged as to cause the discontinuation of a match , or until the degree of hikite is judged to be inappropriate .
the match style called &apos; full-contact &apos; is one in which the contestants are allowed to use direct attacks .
contestants wear no protective gear and fight with bare hands and bare feet .
attacks to vulnerable parts , however , are prohibited , such as punches to the face , kicking the groin and kicking the knee joints .
this is full-contact karate in a more limited sense .
Kyokushin Kaikan and others
the match style ( called &apos; bogutsuki karate &apos; ) is one in which contestants are required to wear protective gear but are allowed to use direct attacks .
this style is adopted by the organizations and circles of bogutsuki karate ( karate with protective gear ) and koshiki karate , a variety of bogutsuki karate .
history
unlike Judo , which is united under the Kodokan Judo Institute , karate has many organizations ( schools ) , and the types of kata , practice methods and match rules differ significantly , depending on the organization .
karate organizations can be roughly divided into two groups : traditional-style ( dentoha ) karate and full-contact karate .
according to Anko ITOSU , karate can be traced back to the two schools introduced from China : the Shorin-ryu school and the Shorei-ryu school .
it is widely accepted that the former became Shuri-te and the latter became Naha-te , but considering that the existence of those two schools hasn &apos;t been confirmed in China , the historical validity of this account has yet to be established .
today &apos;s karate organizations were set up after karate was introduced to the Japanese mainland .
the oldest school that can be found in documents is &quot; Nihon Denryu Heiho Motobu Kenpo &quot; ( Japan &apos;s traditional tactics of Motobu Kenpo ) , or the Motobu-ryu school , which were named in the Taisho period by Choki MOTOBU .
the Shotokan-ryu school , which is associated with Gichin FUNAKOSHI , is actually as old as Motobu-ryu , but Funakoshi never identified himself with any organization ( school ) during his lifetime ; the name &apos; Shotokan-ryu &apos; was coined as a common term after WWII .
in 1931 , during the early Showa period , Chojun MIYAGI called his circle the Goju-ryu school .
dentoha ( Traditional-style ) karate
in a broader sense , dentoha karate ( traditional-style karate ) comprises literally traditional karate organizations , namely koryu karate ( old-style karate ) , hondo karate ( karate in the Japanese mainland , such as organizations affiliated with the JKF ) and Okinawa karate .
occasionally , bogu karate is included in this category .
it is also referred to as &apos; dento karate &apos; ( traditional karate ) .
in a narrower sense , it refers to karate as associated with the JKF , which adopts sundome rules , as well as organizations affiliated with JKF .
the classification below is a rough guide , and many organizations and circles overlap each other .
koryu ( old-style ) karate ( koden karate )
koryu karate is a form of traditional-style karate , which , without aspiring to tournaments or sport , focuses on old karate styles .
it is characterized by the practice of traditional kata and kumite , an emphasis on traditional Okinawan exercise methods and the complementary use of the art of weapons ( buki-jutsu ) .
dentoha karate in a narrower sense ( JKF karate , Sundome karate )
generally , it is often the case that dentoha karate refers to &quot; hondo karate &quot; ( karate on the Japanese mainland ) .
Hondo karate organizations are affiliated with the JKF , focusing on tournaments and the promotion of karate for sport-like use .
it is also known as &apos; sundome karate &apos; because the JKF adopts sundome rules .
it is sometimes referred to as &apos; tournament karate &apos; or &apos; sport karate . &apos;
as schools ( organizations ) of hondo karate , the Goju-ryu , Shotokan-ryu , Wado-ryu and Shito-ryu schools , which are normally called &apos; the four largest schools ( organizations ) &apos; due to their scale , are well known .
recently , match rules have been revised to a great extent : the introduction of the point system that makes game judgment more sport-like than before , the use of different colors for wrist guards ( blue and red , where previously both players wore white wrist guards and a red belt was used to distinguish a red player from a white player ) , and--in a more minute aspect--changes in the numbers and standing positions of referees .
Okinawa karate
the phrase &quot; Okinawa karate &quot; refers to karate organizations and circles that are based in Okinawa .
recently , it has often been the case that Okinawa karate is used as a kind of brand and the antithesis of hondo karate , which has become a sport .
Protesting the decision of the JKF , which is led by organizations on the Japanese mainland , to remove Okinawan kata from the authorized kata , Okinawa karate has stayed away from hondo karate .
however , some organizations and circles of Okinawa karate are affiliated with the JKF , such as Ryuei-ryu school .
like koryu karate , Okinawa karate is characterized by practice of traditional kata , emphasis on traditional exercise methods , and the complementary use of buki-jutsu ( art of weapons ) and toitee-jutsu ( grappling ) .
full-contact karate
full-contact karate , also known as &apos; jissen ( actual fighting ) karate , &apos; refers to karate organizations that adopt direct-attack rules instead of the so-called sundome rules .
the Kyokushin Kaikan , a founding father of full-contact karate , is the most famous , but in a broader sense the varieties of karate shown below are also included .
the history of direct-attack rules is far older than that of sundome rules .
full-contact karate in a more limited sense ( Kyokushin karate )
in a more limited sense , full-contact karate refers to organizations that adopt the rules by which &apos; all direct-attack techniques other than a punch to a face are allowed , &apos; as represented by Kyokushin Kaikan and its offshoots .
recently , however , there has been an increase in the number of organizations that allow a direct attack to the face with the hands ( a punch to the face ) in portions of their matches , such as International F.S.A Kenshin-kan and the Kyokushin-kan .
also , because the number of practitioners in the children &apos;s , juvenile and senior segments is increasing nowadays , it is more common that players other than advanced practitioners will wear headgear and guards .
bogutsuki karate ( koshiki karate )
bogutsuki karate refers to karate matches in which contestants wear protective gear when fighting .
originally , the history of bogutsuki karate is older than that of sundome karate and full-contact karate in terms of kumite match rules ; the National Karatedo Tournament , karate &apos;s first national tournament , was conducted under bogutsuki rules .
some practitioners of bogutsuki karate communicate with full-contact karate and jissen ( actual fighting ) karate practitioners , whereas many bogutsuki karate circles are categorized as dentoha ( traditional-style ) karate .
protective gear such as Strongman and Super Safe are commonly used .
naturally , attacks to the face with the hands ( punches to the face ) are allowed .
incidentally , koshiki karate refers to one genre of bogutsuki karate that adopts a unique scoring system in which the referees take a longer time before they stop a player when he / she succeeds in performing a technique , and additional scores are counted for continuous techniques performed during this interval .
presently , circles have been divided into many factions due to differences of opinion about the types of protective gear and the degree of strength of attacks , a factor that decides the score .
meanwhile , bogutsuki karate is unique in that training halls belong to many circles , and many practitioners can accommodate various sets of rules .
representative circles include All Japan Karatedo Federation Renbukai , All Japan Koshiki Karatedo Organization , All-Japan Shorinji-ryu Karatedo Federation Renshin-kan , Chito-kai Federation , Seishin-ryu , All-Japan Kakuto Dageki Federation , Japan Bogu Karatedo Federation , National Bogu Karatedo Federation , etc .
full-contact karate in the U.S .
originally , full-contact karate refers to a kickboxing-like professional karate , which started in the U.S .
players use no karate uniform and fight in shirtless conditions .
one round lasts two minutes , and bouts are 12 rounds in world-championship tournaments for professional players .
to differentiate it from boxing , American full-contact karate adopts a distinctive rule whereby a contestant is required to kick the opponent &apos;s body from the waist upward more than eight times per round .
players come not only from karate circles in the Japanese mainland and Okinawa but also from Korean taekwondo and Tansudo schools as well as original circles in Western countries including America .
Sogo karate ( kakuto karate , baritudo karate )
Sogo karate refers to karate organizations and circles that adopt mixed martial arts-style games , which incorporate not only striking and kicking arts but also throwing , sparring and grappling techniques .
point &amp; KO rule karate
point &amp; KO rule karate refers to karate organizations and circles that embrace not only the full-contact styles represented by Kyokushin karate but also the &apos; Point &amp; KO &apos; rules , whereby contestants &apos; mastery of techniques is illuminated by adding technical points , regardless of the magnitude of damage , when a contestant performs an accurate kicking technique without allowing the opponent to defend .
point &amp; KO rule karate incorporates traditional karate &apos;s speed and full-contact karate &apos;s destructive power to change karate styles that mainly focus on a strike to the chest and low kicks .
Kyu and dan rank certifications , colored belts and titles
karate &apos;s kyu and dan rank certification system and colored-belt system are modeled on judo &apos;s systems .
it is said that dan ranks were introduced for the first time by Gichin FUNAKOSHI in 1924 .
as for belts , black and white belts were introduced first .
the black belt was for advanced practitioners ( with dan ranks ) whereas the white belt was for novices .
many organizations have introduced the brown belt in-between ( one to three kyu ranks ) .
additionally , below the brown belt , colored belts such as green , yellow and blue were originally introduced for children , but such colored belts have become common in the present day .
detailed definitions of and requirements for kayo and dan rank certification and colored belts differ depending on the organizations , whereas in traditional-style karate the JKF authorizes dan ranks as &apos; certified dan ranks . &apos;
traditionally , the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai ( DNBK ) awarded titles , but after the DNBK was abolished by the GHQ / SCAP , which occupied Japan after WWII , organizations and circles came to award titles in their original ways .
titles comprise Hanshi ( grand master ) , Kyoshi or Tatsushi ( master ) and Renshi ( semi-master ) .
some organizations do not use titles .
karate uniform
it is generally believed that toudee during the era of the Ryukyu Kingdom didn &apos;t employ a karate uniform .
traditionally , practitioners exercised karate in shirtless conditions .
this is obvious from pictures of karate practitioners taken prior to WWII .
Chotoku KYAN explained in &quot; Kenpo Gaisetsu &quot; ( an outline of kenpo , 1929 ) that karate practitioners would exercise in shirtless conditions because &apos; they try to strengthen their skin and concentrate their mind on the balance of strength . &apos;
from Kyan &apos;s statement , which reads , &quot; Since childhood , I have practiced like this , &quot; it would appear that this practice dates at least from the early Meiji period , or probably from the era of the Ryukyu Kingdom .
this practice was not limited to Shuri-te ; from the picture displayed above in which Chojun MIYAGI and Juhatsu KYODA exercise in shirtless conditions , it is considered that this practice was common in Okinawa , including Naha-te .
the prototype of today &apos;s karate uniform is a judo uniform , which Gichin FUNAKOSHI borrowed when he gave a karate demonstration and lectures in 1922 at the Kodokan Judo Institute , under the management of Jigoro KANO .
that is , the original form of the karate uniform was a judo uniform .
generally , judo and karatedo are regarded as separate martial arts , but they share common ground in terms of clothing .
it is unclear when judo and karate uniforms became differentiated , but considering that a karate uniform was advertised in the first issue of &quot; Monthly Karate &quot; ( 1956 ) , it would appear that the karate uniform was developed well after WWII , but there is also a possibility that it was produced before WWII .
because karate &apos;s movement and practice procedures are different from those of judo , alterations were gradually added to the judo uniform , giving birth to today &apos;s karate uniform .
generally , there are differences in the specifications of uniforms for dentoha ( traditional-style ) karate and full-contact karate , as shown below .
( detailed specs differ according to the organization and circle . )
dentoha karate
the sleeves of the uwagi ( jacket ) are wrist-length .
even in sweltering summer heat , practitioners aren &apos;t allowed to roll up their sleeves .
however , at the discretion of instructors ( masters ) the practitioners are sometimes allowed to roll up their sleeves , but only during lessons .
the hem of the jacket features a built-in string , which practitioners knot after wearing the jacket in order to prevent the untidiness of the collar .
the length of a shitabaki ( pants ) should reach to the ankle .
because many organizations and circles allow practitioners to sew on a removable patch with an organization / circle logo , badge , etc . , on the karate jacket , practitioners can purchase karate uniforms from any source without being brokered by training halls ( organizations / circles ) .
full-contact karate
in many cases , the sleeves of the uwagi extend to around the elbow in length , but in some cases nearly sleeveless jackets are used .
the shitabaki ( pant ) is loose , and the legs nearly reach the floor .
changes in teaching methods
during the Ryukyu Kingdom era , karate was taught in secret .
for example , karate was taught at a remote cemetery or at night to avoid being conspicuous .
secrecy was promoted because karate practitioners had to be alert to Satsuma officers stationed in the Ryukyu Kingdom and because they wanted to avoid &apos; kake-dameshi &apos; ( tests of strength ) in challenges by street fighters .
at that time , there were no training halls , and masters accepted only a handful of pupils .
unlike Japanese martial arts , karate had no textbooks , so techniques were passed on by oral tradition or through practical teaching from masters to pupils .
the practice of kata was the main activity in lessons , and it is said that it took three years for a pupil to master one kata .
as for kumite , there was a kind of prearranged kumite , but no systematic free-style kumite ( sparring ) match existed .
those who wanted to try mastered techniques had to do so in street fighting such as kake-dameshi .
after the Meiji period , karate &apos;s teaching methods were drastically changed .
karate was revealed to the public for the first time ; it was adopted as a subject of gymnastics classes in junior high schools and a college of education in Okinawa .
teaching styles changed from one-to-one lessons given by a master to a pupil to class lessons in which a host of students practiced the same movement and kata in response to orders from a master .
around that time , Anko ITOSU created the binan ( peace ) kata so that children could easily learn karate in schools .
during the Taisho period , Okinawa Karate Club was organized in Naha and joined by Okinawan karate grand masters of the day , in which attempts at collaborative studies and coordinated exercises were made for the first time .
also during the Taisho period , books about karate were published for the first time by Gichin FUNAKOSHI and Choki MOTOBU .
in the Showa period , various attempts were made , such as the naming of techniques , the creation of textbooks , research on kumite , and the introduction of matches and tournaments .
also , the kyu and dan rank systems and colored belts systems were introduced , and the exercise system was steadily optimized .
karate experts who organized their own training halls also entered the scene , whereby karate was taught to legions of people .
recently , there has been a growing trend toward the review and reevaluation of koden ( old-style ) karate and Okinawa karate .
karate &apos;s influence in countries other than Japan
south Korea
in South Korea , karatedo was once called konsudo or tansudo , but it developed into a new martial art called taekwondo , which , being arranged and improved in the Korean style , focuses on a kicking art .
a style that had combined Shotokan-ryu karate with another martial art rationally developed into taekwondo decades ago .
also , the number of practitioners of shin-karate , where a contestant is allowed to punch the opponent &apos;s face with the hands wearing 14-ounce gloves , has dramatically increased in recent years due to the popularity of K-1 tournaments .
many heavyweights who led the popularization of taekwondo of mid and late part of the 1940s , such as Master Yi Wong Gwok , the founder of Seitokan , mastered karate in Japan ( mainly Shotokan-ryu karate , since , from the name &apos; Seitokan &apos; the influence of Shotokan is obvious ) .
in an interview , the late General ウ ・ ジョンニム from Seitokan said to a journalist , &apos; I practiced konsudo ; however , the name was conveniently changed ( to taekwondo ) afterwards by a faction led by General チェ ・ ホンヒ . &apos;
these anecdotes prove that originally there was no martial art called taekwondo but there was konsudo , which was taught by people who had learned karate and opened training halls after Japan &apos;s occupation ended , with the name konsudo being subsequently changed to &apos; taekwondo . &apos;
the United States of America
it is said that American karate began when veterans of WWII , who had mastered karate in Okinawa or the Japanese mainland , opened karate schools in the U.S. after their return to the country .
it is widely accepted that it was Robert Trias ( 1923 - 1989 ) , often called the &apos; father of American karate , &apos; who taught karate in the U.S. for the first time .
however , there are assertions that other people introduced karate to the U.S. for the time , and agreement has yet to be reached .
Europe
in Europe , karate spread after the 1960 &apos;s through karate instructors dispatched from Japan to Europe .
it is reported that many instructors were instrumental , such as Hirokazu KANAZAWA ( Shotokan-ryu ) , who taught karate in Germany and England , and Morio HIGAONNA ( Goju-ryu ) , who taught karate in Portugal .
in the USSR , the first karate club was set up at a university in Moscow in the mid-1960s .
however , since the downfall of the Soviet Union karate has been practiced again in Russia .

onsen tamago ( onsen eggs ) are a type of soft boiled egg , or chicken eggs with the yoke soft and the white only half done .
there are also soft boiled eggs called &apos; ondo tamago . &apos;
also , eggs which have been steamed in the steam of hot springs ( onsen ) or boiled in the hot water are called onsen tamago regardless of whether they are hard or soft .
outline
in contrast to the usual soft boiled egg , the characteristic of the onsen tamago is that the egg white is softer than the egg yoke .
this is because they are cooked in water that is between 65 - 68 ° C for 30 minutes , to take advantage of the fact that the temperature at which the yoke hardens ( 70 ° C is lower than the temperature at which the egg white hardens 80 ° C ) .
if the water temperature of water gushing from a hot spring is close to this range , the onsen eggs can be made just by placing eggs in the spring water , so they are often served at hotels in hot spring ( onsen ) resorts and this is thought to be the origin of the term onsen egg .
they are often cracked and put in a bowl with dashi ( stock ) and soya sauce .
they are also used as a topping for noodle dishes and donburi dishes ( fish or meat and vegetables served on rice ) .
they are far more digestible than eggs cooked in any other way .
specialized &apos; Onsen egg cookers &apos; are available however they can be made by using a container that retains heat such as a polystyrene container ( see &apos; How to make onsen eggs at home &apos; ) .
they can also be made without using water , by using a rice cooker on the warm setting .
the onsen eggs on sale at some restaurants ( such as Yoshinoya ) under the name soft boiled egg are products called &apos; Cupid &apos;s eggs &apos; manufactured by Q.P.Corporation .
like soft-boiled eggs , onsen eggs may be a source of food poisoning if the eggs are not fresh .
chicken eggs boiled in hot spring water or steamed in the hot spring steam are called onsen eggs regardless of whether they are soft or hard boiled .
at many hot spring resorts , shops demonstrate the cooking of onsen eggs in hot spring steam or water and the onsen eggs are sold as specialties .
if the onsen has a high level of sodium chloride the eggs will often taste salty .
the onsen eggs of Iizaka hot springs in Fukushima City , Fukushima Prefecture are called radium eggs as it is the first onsen in Japan at which the presence of radium was detected in the water .
the specialty eggs of Owakudani hot springs in Hakone and Goshogake hot springs are black .
this is because the iron in the hot springs turns the egg shells black .
it is only the shells that are black , and the inside of the egg is the same as a normal boiled egg .
the source of the hot springs of Yumura hot springs ( Hyogo Prefecture ) is the hottest spring water in Japan ( 98 ° C ) and it does not need to be heated up .
the onsen eggs can be cooked in 10 minutes .
most people who visit put a raw egg in the Arayu spring water .
at Unzen hot springs , eggs are available which have a slightly sulfurous smell and have been cooked in a steamer using steam from Jigokudani valley .
the salt added is not the usual salt but salt made from the hot springs .
most people drink Ramune lemonade ( soft drink ) when eating the eggs .
each of the Jigoku spring areas on the Beppu Jigoku Meguri ( Beppu Hell Tour ) of Beppu hot springs has specialty onsen eggs which are steamed or boiled in the hot spring water .
apart from jigoku steamed eggs which are steamed in a stone steamer which utilizes steam from a hot spring , at Umi jigoku hot springs on the Beppu Jigoku ( Hell ) Tour , the specialty is jigoku boiled eggs which are eggs that have been put in bamboo baskets and put directly into the 98 ° C cobalt blue hot springs .
put an egg into a polystyrene container ( such as a cup noodle container ) that will retain heat and add hot water .
put in just enough hot water to cover the egg .
put a lid on and leave it for 30 to 40 minutes .
if you suddenly cover an egg which has just been taken out of the refrigerator with hot water it will crack , so it is a good idea to warm up the egg a little first in warm water before putting in the hot water .
furthermore , if you boil an egg for 20 to 25 minutes at between 70 to 75 degrees , you can make an onsen egg without the necessity for a container , however it is necessary to have a way of maintaining the boiling and temperature .
also , it is possible to make an onsen egg using a paper drip type coffee machine .
this is a simple way as you just put a raw egg into the coffee pot and turn it on without adding the filter paper or coffee beans .
even with this method , if the egg is cold it will crack so it is a good idea to let it return to room temperature .
Yoshinoya added onsen eggs to its menu in 2003 under the name soft boiled egg .
the Bon festival dance is an event enjoyed in groups at night during the season of Bon , the Buddhist festival for the dead held around the fifteenth of August ( or July in some regions ) .
the general style of the Bon festival dance is that a tower is set up at the center of an open space ; a caller atop the tower sings a folk song for a dance , and participants dance to the song as they circle the tower .
the Bon festival dance is said to have originated from nenbutsu-odori ( a dance with an invocation to the Buddha ) .
in haiku , or Japanese seventeen-syllable poetry , the Bon festival dance is used as kigo ( a seasonal word ) of summer .
the Bon festival dance is one of the major events during the summer vacation period .
the dance was once an all-night event , but nowadays it is rarely held through to the late-night hours .
in most cases , a folk song for the dance is used as the accompaniment in the Bon festival dance .
in some areas , the folk song for the dance is performed with a live drum , a live shamisen ( three-string Japanese banjo ) and a live caller , just as it was in the past .
occasionally , instead of a shamisen , an electric bass or a rhythm box is used as an instrument .
recently , callers and hayashikata ( people performing the accompaniment with traditional Japanese instruments ) have decreased in number , so in many cases the playback of a folk song for a dance recorded beforehand serves as a substitute .
each local community has a folk song for a dance , as well as its own dance style .
in some areas from the Kanto region to the Kinki region , the Bon festival dance is also called &apos; higan odori &apos; ( the dance of autumnal equinoctial week ) , which is named after the season in which the festival is held .
if the festival is held during the period of about ten days leading up to higan ( the autumnal equinoctial week ) , the dance is called &apos; higan odori , &apos; and if the festival is held at another time it &apos;s called a summer festival or an autumn festival in most cases .
a popular belief is that the name &apos; higan odori &apos; hadn &apos;t been used until someone jokingly called the festival &apos; higan odori &apos; for its season .
the name is said to have originated in Hokusetsu , Osaka , or in the western part of Tokyo Metropolis , but its exact birthplace is unknown .
historically , the Bon festival dance has functioned as an entertainment and a way to strengthen people &apos;s bonds in the village community .
accordingly , there are many local communities throughout Japan that have their own folk songs for a dance featuring their particular localities ; it &apos;s not at all rare for a municipality , or a chamber of commerce and industry , to compose an original local folk song for the dance .
before the Meiji period , the Bon festival dance related to other customs , such as utagaki ( a religious event of ancient times , at which people exchanged forms of poetic verses such as waka , a form of Japanese poem consisting of 32 syllables ) .
the songs exemplified below aren &apos;t limited to folk songs but also include pop tunes .
please refer to &quot; The list of songs in the style of a folk song . &quot;
Tanko Bushi ( A Folk Tune of a Coal Mine ) : a folk song in Fukuoka Prefecture
this song is used at Bon festival dances throughout Japan .
in many cases , the recorded song sung by Masao SUZUKI is used .
Tokyo Ondo ( A Folk Song of Tokyo for a Dance )
Dai Tokyo Ondo ( A Folk Song of Big Tokyo for a Dance )
Kawachi Ondo ( A Folk Song of Kawachi for a Dance ) : in Osaka Prefecture
Goshu Ondo ( A Folk Song of Goshu for a Dance ) : this song is enjoyed throughout the Kansai area , including Shiga Prefecture , but it &apos;s said to have originated in Higashi-Omi City .
Hokkai Bon Uta ( A Folk Song of Hokkaido for the Bon Festival Dance ) : in Hokkaido Prefecture
Kodomo Bon Odori Uta ( A Children &apos;s Folk Song of Hokkaido for the Bon Festival Dance ) : in Hokkaido Prefecture
Zundoko Bushi ( A Folk Tune Interjected as a Refrain of Zundoko )
Soran Bushi ( A Folk Tune Interjected as a Refrain of Soran )
Nanyadoyara ( A Folk Tune Interjected as a Refrain of Nanyadoyara ) : this tune is also called Nanyatoyara , and it &apos;s enjoyed in the northern part of Iwate Prefecture , the southern part of Aomori Prefecture and the Kazuno district of Akita Prefecture .
Gujo Bushi ( A Folk Tune of Gujo ) : in Gifu Prefecture
Nagoya Bayashi ( A Folk Song of Nagoya for the Bon Festival Dance ) : in Aichi Prefecture
Dai Nagoya Ondo ( A Folk Song of Big Nagoya for a Dance ) : in Aichi Prefecture
Dekansho Bushi ( A Folk Tune Interjected as a Refrain of Dekansho ) : in Sasayama City , Hyogo Prefecture
similar events are held in the communities of Japanese immigrants , such as those of Hawaii and California .
the events are similarly called &apos; Bon dances , &apos; but the repertoire of the dances and songs is replaced with those of the respective communities .
in most cases , a drummer and a caller ( both on a tower ) and dancers conventionally wear yukata ( a Japanese summer kimono ) , but it &apos;s okay for general participants to wear ordinary clothes .
if dancers belong to the same group , in most cases they &apos;ll wear matching yukata .
in some cases , women put their uchiwa ( a round fan ) between the back of the yukata and the obi ( broad sash around the waist ) .
moreover , in some cases the men dance with hachimaki ( headbands ) on their heads and inro ( small decorative cases ) suspended from their waists .
in some regions , a mask of a fox or something is worn , while in other regions thick makeup ( like stage makeup ) and gorgeous clothing are worn .
the Bon festival dance was originally a Buddhist event .
in the Heian period , the virtuous Buddhist priest Kuya began nenbutsu-odori ( a dance with an invocation to the Buddha ) .
combined with Urabon ( the formal name of Bon ) , this seems to have been regarded as the event for greeting the spirits of--and paying homage to--the dead .
it is said that people started dancing to the drumbeat at the beginning of the Muromachi period .
even today , there are local areas where the Bon festival dance is held as an act of homage to those who have died since the last Bon .
people dance to the drumbeat and the lyrics , which are called &apos; kudoki . &apos;
besides serving the dance , kudoki also shows us the cultural tradition of the local community .
in some areas , the festival participants dance going around each of the houses in which someone has died since the last Bon .
the Bon festival dance was once held on July 15 , based on the lunar calendar .
thus the dance was always done under a full moon .
Kintoki is the childhood name of SAKATA no Kintoki ( his name is sometimes written as &quot; 公時 &quot; instead of &quot; 金時 . &quot;
also , Kintaro is the title of legendary literature and stories for children for which Kintaro is the hero .
history and legend
there are many legends about Kintaro .
according to a record in Kintoki-jinja Shrine ( shrine in which Kintaro is enshrined ) in Oyama-cho , Sunto-gun , Shizuoka Prefecture , he was born in May , 956 .
it is said that Yaegiri , a daughter of the carver Jubei , conceived Kintaro when she visited Kyoto and met Kurando SAKATA who served in the Imperial Court .
Yaegiri returned to her hometown and gave birth to Kintaro , upon the death of Sakata , she decided not go back to Kyoto , but raised Kintaro in her hometown .
Kintaro grew into a healthy , dutiful and gentle child whom it is said practiced sumo wrestling with a bear on Mt . Ashigara .
on April 28 , 976 , he met MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu , who happened to pass along the Ashigara-toge road and was impressed by the strength of Kintaro , and engaged him as a retainer .
he changed his name to Kintoki SAKATA and went Kyoto and became a member of Yorimitsu Shitenno ( four loyal retainers of Yorimitsu ) .
the other members of the Yorimitsu &apos;s Shitenno were Tsuna WATANABE , Suetake URABE and Sadamitsu USUI .
on April 28 , 990 , they vanquished Shuten Doji ( the leader of a group of bandits that roamed the region around Kyoto ) who lived on Mt . Oe ( currently Fukuchiyama City , Kyoto Prefecture ) .
Shuten Doji terrorized Kyoto with his evil acts .
MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu and the members of Shitenno dressed as yamabushi ( mountain priest ) and got rid of Shuten Doji using an alcoholic drink containing a sleeping drug .
on January 17 , 1012 , when he was on his way to Tsukushi ( present Kitakyushu City ) to overthrow bandits in Kyushu , Kintoki SAKATA contracted a serious fever and died in Mimasaka Katsutaso on Sakushu road ( present Shoo Town in Okayama Prefecture ) .
he was fifty-five years old when he died .
people in Katsuta adored Kintoki and established Kurigara ( meaning adamantine courage ) -jinja Shrine to mourn him .
the shrine is presently called Kurikira-jinja Shrine .
the above describes the legend of Kintaro as recorded in the Kintoki-jinja Shrine .
however , some say his existence is doubtful .
according to historical materials at that time such as FUJIWARA no Michinaga &apos;s diary , &quot; Mido Kanpakuki , &quot; an excellent guardsman named SHIMOTSUKENU no Kintoki served Michinaga .
it seems that this Kintoki was gradually modified into Kintaro .
in &quot; Konjaku monogatari shu &quot; ( collection of tales of present and past ) that were recorded approximately 100 years after the time of Yorimitsu and Michinaga , it is recorded that Kintoki served as a retainer of Yorimitsu .
the present legend of Kintaro was perfected in the Edo period , and the image of a boy with immense physical strength among Yorimitsu &apos;s Shitenno became fixed in popular culture through Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a shamisen ( a three-stringed Japanese banjo ) accompaniment ) and Kabuki ( traditional drama performed by male actors ) .
he became the model of dolls for the Boys &apos; Festival in May as an active boy wearing a diamond shaped bib with a battle-ax on his shoulder riding on the back of a bear .
based on this figure , rhombic bibs used for babies and toddlers all over Japan were also called &apos; Kintaro . &apos;
with respect to legends of his birth , one legend has it that his mother was a mountain witch and his father was the god of lightning and another where he was a baby that was given to Yaegiri by a red dragon on the top of Mt . Kintoki .
the &apos; Kintoki bean &apos; is named after him , and the &apos; Kinpira &apos; style of cooking is named after his son Kinpira SAKATA .
in both Minamiashigara City neighboring Oyama town , there are many legends about Kintaro and there are many differences in the contents of the legends of the two cities .
other than those , there are legends associated with Kintaro in various locations such as at the grave in the Mangan-ji Temple ( Kawanishi City ) , Kawanishi City , Hyogo Prefecture and Nagahama City in Shiga Prefecture .
in the Kintoki-jinja Shrine , Oyama town , Sunto-gun , Shizuoka Prefecture , there are legends associated with Kintaro surrounding the Chorori nanataki waterfall and the Dairokutensha shrine .
it is said that water of Chorori nanataki waterfall was used for Kintaro &apos;s first bath when he was born and it is located in the back of his residence which is now the site of Kintoki-jinja Shrine .
because Kintaro grew up healthy and became an excellent commander , people in the neighborhood used water of this waterfall for their first born .
in Minamiashigara City , however , there is a waterfall called Yuhi no taki , and legend there has it that Kintaro was born in the residence of Shimanchoja and water from this waterfall was used for this first bath .
Kintaro and his mother had great faith in the Dairokutensha shrine and while his mother , Yaegiri , dedicated steamed rice with red beans , or fish , Kintaro caught killifishes and put the live fish in a bowl in front of the shrine as an offering .
Nagahama and Maibara Cities in Shiga Prefecture were previously part of Sakata County and it is said that SAKATA no Kintoki was from Sakata County .
even now , there are several Ashigara-jinja Shrines ( 足柄神社 and 芦柄神社 ) and children &apos;s sumo competitions are still held in Nagahama City .
the region was the base of the ancient and powerful Okinaga clan and Kintoki was a member of the clan .
it says that the character 王 ( king ) is a hieroglyphic character representing a war ax and the figure with a bib symbolizes a blacksmith and , therefore , it was a powerful clan that was among the first to introduce the use of iron forging .
children &apos;s song
the children &apos;s song &apos; Kintaro , &apos; that begins with &apos; masakari katsuide &apos; ( having a war ax on the shoulder ) , was published in &apos; Yonen Shoka &apos; ( children &apos;s songs ) in 1900 . ( for your reference , this is not &apos; masakari katsuida &apos; as it is often sung erroneously . )
lyrics by Kazusaburo ISHIHARA , music by Torazo TAMURA
Shunbun ( Vernal Equinox ) is one of the 24 seasons in the solar year .
it falls around March 21 .
or , it is the period from that day until Clear and Bright ( Seimei ) season in the same solar calendar .
mid February
in astronomy Shunbun is defined as the very moment that the sun transits through the vernal equinox .
that is , just when the sun is visible at the celestial longitude of 0 degrees .
in historical almanacs the vernal equinox is explained as being &apos; Mid point between the sun and the heavens when the division between day and night is identical &apos; and , holds true that at the vernal equinox , day and night are roughly the same length .
however , in actual fact , daytime is longer than the night
in the vicinity of Japan there are variations from year to year but , on average daytime is approximately 14 minutes longer than night time .
this is because of the following reasons .
due to refraction in the atmosphere , the sun can look higher than it actually is .
the portion of the sun that is visible due to the higher aspect results in an earlier dawn and later sunset .
refraction makes the sun look larger the closer it is to the horizon .
at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan , when the sun is close to the horizon , the angle is estimated to be 35 minutes 8 seconds .
from this it can be calculated that the time difference between dawn and sunset is 2 minutes 20 seconds .
dawn or sunset is defined as the very moment when the top edge of the sun is aligned with the horizon
due to this , the radius of the sun can cause dawn to be early or sunset late .
the variance in timing between dawn and sunset can be extrapolated from this to be 1 minute 5 seconds .
putting both these together , at dawn the centre of the sun rises from the horizon 3 minutes 25 seconds faster and , at sunset sinks 3 minutes 25 seconds slower from the centre of the sun to the horizon .
accordingly , the length of daytime at the vernal equinox is approximately 12 hours 7 minutes and , the night approximately 11 hours 53 minutes long .
also , actually the day when the variance between day and night is substantially smaller occurs approximately 4 days after the vernal equinox .
during those days forming the vernal equinox , the sun rises from due East and sets due West .
if a person makes observations from above the equator , the sun passes through the zenith at mid day .
if a person makes observations at the North or South Pole , the vernal equinox sun will appear to be moving right along the horizon ; not rising or sinking .
in Japan , Shunbun No Hi ( Vernal Equinox Day ) is a public holiday .
the Japanese Cabinet decides upon Shunbun No Hi based on the astronomical Autumnal Equinox calculated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and , an announcement of the decision is officially gazetted in February the previous year .
it is unusual elsewhere in the world to have a public holiday decided upon each year based on astronomy .
also , Vernal Equinox Day occurs during the 7 days of spring Higan ( equinoctial ) week .
prior to WWII the day was a national holiday in recognition of the imperial ceremony of ancestor worship .
in Europe etc , the vernal equinox marks the opening of spring .
the day is a public holiday in a number of countries .
in Christianity , the vernal equinox is used as a reference point when calculating the date of Easter .
the Sunday following the first full-moon after the vernal equinox is set as Easter .
this calculation method is called &quot; Computus . &quot;
that said , while the calendar &apos; vernal equinox &apos; date is fixed as March 21 , the dates of astronomical vernal equinox days do not always coincide .
while the &apos; full moon &apos; dates can also be obtained from simplified calculations , the astronomical full moon dates may not always coincide .
this method of calculation was decided upon at the First Council of Nicaea .
the 72 &apos; climates &apos; occurring during the Vernal Equinox are as follows :
new season
sparrow &apos;s First Nest : sparrows start to stand in the nest ( Japan ) .
swallows Arrive : swallows arrive from the South ( China ) .
next season :
sakura First Blossom : sakura begins to bloom . ( Japan )
thunder Begins to Sound : in the distance the sound of thunder begins ( China ) .
latter season
thunder Begins to Sound : in the distance the sound of thunder begins ( Japan ) .
first Thunder : first flashes of lightning ( China ) .
Keichitsu ( Insects Awaken ) = &gt; Shunbun ( Vernal Equinox ) = &gt; Seimei ( Clear and Bright )
sake is a traditional alcoholic drink in Japan that is produced by fermenting rice .
it is called seishu in the Japanese Liquor Tax Law .
in Japan , it is called in general simply &quot; sake &quot; or &quot; osake , &quot; and &quot; sasa &quot; in old Japanese and &quot; hannyato &quot; in jargon of Buddhism priests .
in modern times , it is sometimes called &quot; ponshu . &quot;
it has a wide temperature range good for drinking , from five degrees centigrade approx. to sixty degrees centigrade approx . ( refer to &quot; Expressions of temperature - drinking temperature . &quot; )
sake is the only alcoholic drink in the world which is habitually drunk at different temperatures in the same area .
it is also used for cooking as seasoning agent for cleaning away odor of fishery products and flavoring .
recently , while consumption in Japan shows as declining tendency , consumption of sake , in particular , ginjoshu ( high-quality sake brewed at low temperatures from rice grains milled to sixty percent weight or less ) and junmai ginjoshu ( ginjoshu with no added alcohol ) in overseas market has been growing and it is known as &quot; sake . &quot;
( refer to &quot; History of Sake : Showa Period and On . &quot; )
refer to &quot; History of Sake . &quot;
principal raw materials of sake are rice , water and koji ( malted rice ) .
other than such ingredients , as sake is brewed using many substances such as yeast and lactic acid bacterium , all of them are in certain cases called &quot; ingredients for making sake . &quot;
among specialists , &quot; distilled alcohol , &quot; &quot; sour agent , &quot; &quot; seasoning , &quot; &quot; amino acid , &quot; and &quot; sugars , &quot; which are used for adjusting the flavor are called auxiliary ingredients in order to distinguish them .
rice
depending on the intended use , there are two types of rice , namely kojimai ( rice for koji ) and kakemai ( rice used to produce moromi or raw unseishu ) .
for kojimai , sakamai ( shuzo kotekimai - literally , rice suitable for brewing sake ) is usually used .
usually , general-purpose rice is used totally or partially for kakemai , but , in case of sake with a specific class name , often only sakamai is used .
for most futsushu ( ordinary sake ) , general-purpose rice is used for kojimai and kakemai .
however , even from general-purpose rice , sake that receives high marks of appreciation is produced .
with respect to high-class sake , once Yamadanishiki enjoyed a predominant position , but recently the way of selecting and using rice as raw materials has drastically been changed partly because of the development of new varieties of sakamai .
for more information , refer to &quot; Sakamai . &quot;
water
water is the principal ingredient that makes up eighty percent of sake and an important factor that determines the quality .
the water supply source is usually well water such as infiltrated and subsoil water .
in certain places where conditions are met , tap water is the source , many breweries secure a dedicated source of water supply .
with respect to breweries in urban districts , some transport water from a remote locations because of the deterioration of local water quality and some change the brewery location to a location that has a water supply with good quality .
water used for brewing sake is called shuzo yosui ( literally , water for sake brewing ) and used as water for preparation for brewing and water for cleaning bottles and buckets .
some breweries sell water preparaed for brewing as merchandise .
the hardness of water is one element that determines the taste of sake .
in daily life in Japan , we usually use American standards for measuring the hardness of water , but , in the brewery industry , German standards have been used from a long time ago .
recently , we can see a shift to American standards .
with respect to the taste of sake produced , roughly speaking , if soft water is used , so-called soft sake with delayed fermentation is obtained and , if hard water is used , hard sake with progressed fermentation is obtained .
the reason is that , if hard water is used in the brewing process , yeast becomes vivid because of the existence of minerals and therefore alcoholic fermentation , namely the decomposition of sugar , is expedited .
on the contrary , if soft water is used , and the mineral content is little , yeast activity becomes dull and fermentation takes more time .
Nada gogo ( literally , five districts in Nada ) where high quality sake have been produced since the Edo Period , hard water called Miyamizu have been used .
on the other hand , in 1897 , Senzaburo MIURA , who lived in Hiroshima Prefecture , developed a fermenting technique with soft water .
in the past , hard water was used to make much of the shuzo yosui , but , in recent years , new merits of soft water have been discovered and the taste of sake brewed with soft water matches the taste of people today .
from olden times , a majority of the breweries existed in the vicinity of a river .
the reason is to draw infiltrated water up from the river as shuzo yosui .
among the raw materials used for sake , water is the only ingredient not included in mandatory information .
therefore , it is not required to reveal whether water used as raw material for sake is from a well or is tap water .
however , water quality criteria applied to shuzo yosui is far stricter than for tap water .
sake breweries are required to submit water used for brewing to the brewing laboratory , food laboratory , brewing guidance institute , etc . , in the prefecture for examination in advance .
examinations are conducted on the following items :
odor
taste
color
turbidity
hydrogen-ion exponent
chlorine ion
calcium
overall hardness
magnesium
Trichlorethylene
phosphorus
should not be detected .
amount of consumption of permanganic acid potassium salt
should not be detected .
should not be detected .
mercury
iron
acceptable range : 0.02 mg / l or less ( for tap water : 0.3 mg / l or less )
acceptable range : 0.02 mg / l or less ( for tap water : 0.3 mg / l or less )
different from the Chinese continent , water in almost all districts in Japan is medium-hard water , although there is a slight difference depending on the district , and , since the content of iron and manganese that spoils the taste is small , it is suitable for brewing .
we often hear that breweries that moved to Manchuria before the Pacific War and tried to brew sake for Japanese people who lived there , had difficulty finding water that could be used .
with respect to potassium , magnesium , and phosphoric acid in minute amounts that are effective for fermentation and propagation of aspergillus and yeast , we can add them to adjust the ingredients .
shuzo yosui used for sake brewing is classified as follows :
water which is used for sake during the brewing process as an ingredient
water that is used for washing and soaking rice
also water that is absorbed in rice before preparation for brewing .
water added as main raw materials at the time of brewing
we can say that it is one of reasons to make sake a &quot; liquid &quot; merchandise . &quot;
water that is used for cleaning and boiler .
even for such purposes , shuzo yosui that has fulfilled the rigid criteria described in the section for water quality , is used .
water for bottling
water that is used for cleaning bottles
water that is added to adjust alcohol content
it is transformed into sake after brewing .
water that is used for cleaning tanks and buckets
even for such purposes , shuzo yosui that has fulfilled the rigid criteria described in the section for water quality , is used .
for daily life of the toji ( chief sake brewer ) and other workers in the brewery ( for food and washing their hands and face , etc . ) , tap water is used as it is in lives of other people .
what is interesting is that , in many sake breweries , shuzo yosui is used in the bath for workers in the brewery .
it is because of the belief of the sake breweries that the &quot; preparation for brewing &quot; begins already from that stage and they do out of superstition for good luck .
koji ( malted rice )
koji used for sake brewing is produced by sprinkling spores of koji mold , namely aspergillus onto steamed rice and it is also called rice koji .
koji converts rice starch into glucose , and carries out saccharification .
the main ingredient of rice , which is a cereal , is starch , which is a polysaccharide , and it cannot be utilized as source of energy for yeast .
therefore , it is necessary to decompose it into sugar having a smaller molecular weight with the action of koji .
in other words , since yeast cannot carry out alcohol fermentation directly from starch , starch must be saccharified in preparation for fermentation .
in case of sake , rice koji plays such role .
rice koji contains amylase and glucoamylase , which are degrading enzymes produced by koji mold and degrade starch .
those degrading enzymes carry out saccharification .
rice koji also contains degrading enzymes for protein and amino acids and peptides produced by degradation have an affect on the growth of yeast and the flavor of the final sake . ( refer to &quot; Producing koji . &quot; )
in case of foreign liquors , for example wine , because grape juice as raw material contains glucose , no additional saccharification process is required and zones of culture of single-stage fermentation is formed .
in the East , koji is used for many food products , not only for sake , but also for other liquors , bean pastes , mirin ( sweet cooking rice wine ) , soy sauces and , etc .
that is the reason why such zones are called , from the food culture point of view , zones of culture of multiple-stage fermentation or zones of mold culture .
this is a method of fermentation that is possible because of climate characteristics of medium- or high-temperature wet zones in the Southeast to East Asia and the method utilizes the effect of &quot; mold &quot; as a microorganism .
there are various type of aspergillus used in the East .
typically , white koji , kuro koji ( kuro-koji bacterium ) and yellow koji is used for shochu ( distilled spirit ) , kuro koji for awamori ( distilled spirit originated in Okinawa ) , and aka koji ( ang-khak ) for Shaoxing rice wine .
in case of sake , ki koji ( yellow aspergillus ) is used the same as in bean paste , mirin , and soy sauce .
although it is called &quot; yellow &quot; koji , its color is actually closer to green or yellow green in reality .
if classified by their shapes , koji used in Japan is in the shape of rice grain as it is , as far as can be observed by the naked eye , and , therefore , it is called bara koji ( literally , loose koji ) .
on the other hand , koji used in other Eastern countries , including China , is called mochi koji ( literally , rice-cake koji ) .
it is produced by adding water to raw materials , grain powder such as rice and wheat , and stiffening them by kneading and spores of rhizopus or mucon existing naturally adhere to and grow on it .
although it is not the main raw material , it is noted here because it is an important factor for sake brewing .
for more information , refer to &quot; Sake yeast . &quot;
from the biological point of view , yeast is a monocellular organism that belongs to fungi .
in sake brewing , it usually means budding yeast .
in the natural world , there exist over several hundred thousand types of such yeast , and each has its own quality .
the diverse qualities of yeast is an important key to determine taste , flavor , and quality of sake .
among the large number of yeasts , yeasts used for sake brewing are called sake yeast and more than eighty percent of the varieties are Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( budding yeast ) .
prior to the modern era , in the process of mixing koji and water , yeasts naturally existing in the air were taken into or &quot; yeast of the house &quot; or &quot; yeast of a brewing house &quot; were utilized .
it was left to chance , scientific reproducibility was lacking and the quality of brewed sake could not be stabilized .
during the Meiji period , through the introduction of microbiology , selection and breeding of useful seed bacteria and thanks to distribution of such seed bacteria , the stabilization of and improvement in quality could be realized .
after the first Zenkoku Shinshu Kanpyokai ( National New Sake Appraising and Deliberating Fair ) was held in 1911 , the Brewing Society of Japan commenced to collect useful yeasts nationwide and the yeasts judged objectively to be excellent , for example , by winning the first prize were collected and distributed after cultivating a pure culture .
yeast delivered in such a way was named &quot; Sake yeast Kyokai No. n &quot; ( &quot; n &quot; stands for a number . ) after Nihon Jozo Kyokai ( the Brewing Society of Japan ) .
such yeasts are called Kyokai-line yeast or Kyokai yeast .
it is divided roughly into bubbling yeasts that produce carbon dioxide during alcoholic fermentation and non-bubbling yeasts .
originally , sake had only the simple fragrance that rice has and does not have a fruity fragrance like wine .
sake yeast Kyokai No. 7 and Sake yeast Kyokai No. 9. among Kyokai-line yeasts played a big role in giving birth to ginjoshu ( high-quality sake brewed at low temperatures from rice grains milled to sixty percent weight or less ) and junmai ginjoshu that has a fragrance .
in the 1980 &apos;s , once ginjoshu was widely accepted by consumers , a large number of yeasts that produce a strong fragrance such as low-acidity yeast , high ester producing yeast , and high malic acid producing high acidity yeast were made in addition to Kyokai-line yeasts .
even today , various yeasts are created by large manufacturers , biological research institutes , and universities .
in and after 1990 &apos;s , sake yeasts named after the place of development , such as Shizuoka yeast , Yamagata yeast , Akita yeast and Fukushima yeast came to be highly valued .
recently , attention is focused on the fact that yeasts that produce high content of ethyl caproate represented by alps yeast as well as yeasts from flowers that were separated by Tokyo University of agriculture from flowers of dianthus , begonia and climbing rose extract strong ginjoko ( fragrance of ginjo sake ) .
ginjoko with respect to sake , however , similar to the fact that if one applies too much perfume , it gives the opposite effect of what was expected , may spoil the taste of the sake if flavor of ginjoshu is too much .
therefore , under certain situations , yeasts that give too strong of a ginjo fragrance to sake are kept at a distance by breweries .
with respect to such yeasts , we can say that their use is still in the groping stage , for example blending with other yeasts or limiting its use for sake to be exhibited in kanpyokai ( sake exhibition ) .
although natural lactic acid bacteria are used in certain cases , it is often added .
same as with yeasts , there are &quot; lactic acid bacteria for brewing &quot; by the Brewing Society of Japan .
lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria plays an important role especially at the initial stage of preparation to prevent propagation of other bacteria .
acids including lactic acid gives &quot; koshi &quot; to sake .
if sake includes no acid whatsoever , it becomes just sweet water including alcohol .
in sake brewing , it is important to appropriately produce acids .
items which are classified officially as auxiliary materials
( items to be denoted on the label )
it is added to moromi ( raw unseishu ) to give an elegant taste to sake or to cause the fragrance to remain .
in certain cases , distilled alcohol is added just to increase the volume ( three-time increased sake ) .
sake added with distilled alcohol is called arutenshu ( literally , sake added with alcohol ) .
sugar
sugar adds sweetness to sake .
in certain cases , sugar is added as a saccharified solution and fermented .
amino acid adds umami to sake .
flavoring adds umami to sake .
sour agent adds sour taste to sake .
( items not denoted on the label )
in certain cases , exogenous enzyme is used to supplement the &quot; enzyme &quot; produced by aspergillus .
if the weight is less than one thousandth of that of raw materials , it is not treated as a raw material .
it is used to remove zatsumi ( unfavorable taste in sake ) .
if too much activated charcoal is used , the taste of sake becomes thin .
Fining agent
filter aid
sake is classified as a brewage same as beer and wine and alcohol is obtained by fermenting raw materials .
different from wine , however , in the case of beer and sake , as no sugar is included in the raw materials , but the process of saccharification is necessary .
although in the case of beer , sweet wort is fermented after it is completely saccharified , this is a significant feature of sake brewing that a process in which saccharification and fermentation are carried out in parallelism , exists .
this unique brewing method for sake , called parallel multi-stage fermentation , is the factor that makes it possible for it to have a higher alcohol content than other brewages .
sake is brewed through the following stages during the process .
bran and embryo are removed and albumen is scraped .
the ratio of scraping is denoted as the rice-polishing ratio .
protein and oil contained in rice exists mainly in the outer portion of the grain of rice .
in the brewing process , as protein and oil cause zatsumi , they are scraped off carefully so that the grains of rice are not fractured in order to produce a sophisticated taste .
on the other hand , the higher the rice-polishing ratio , the more difficult to use most of characteristics of the varieties of rice and the more minerals and vitamins , which promote fermentation , are lost , a highly sophisticated technique is required for subsequent stages .
if the speed of rice polishing is too high , rice generates heat and degenerates or becomes fractured and becomes unusable , it should be carried out carefully .
with respect to ginjo and daiginjo , the problem is that not only the portion to be scraped off is large , but also the object becomes smaller and requires special attention , the time needed for rice polishing sometimes exceeds two full days .
since around 1930 , thanks to emergence of an upright rice polisher , faster high grade rice polishing became possible .
later , this also made mass production of ginjoshu possible . ( refer to &quot; Birth of Ginjoshu . &quot; )
recently , there are large manufacturers who polish rice by controlling the upright rice polisher with a computer .
&quot; Horei &quot; ( sanding to cool ) or &quot; karashi &quot; means to leave white rice after polishing , sake mash after wake and koji after koji delivery as they are until using in the next stage .
polished rice carries certain a degree of heat caused by friction .
the higher the rice-polishing ratio is or the longer the time of rice-polishing is , the bigger the heat volume will be .
as the quality of rice is not stabilized as it is to proceed to the next stage ( according to the language of toji and other workers in the brewery &quot; the rice is not settled . &quot; ) , it is put into bags and left in the warehouse for a while to cool down .
moisture evaporated by heat caused by friction is restored .
such a step is called &quot; horei &quot; or , in the language of toji and other workers in brewery &quot; karashi . &quot;
even if we say &quot; for a while , &quot; this work cannot be completed within several hours , it takes usually three to four weeks until heat caused by friction is totally radiated and the rice settles down .
with respect to the polished rice , bran and rice powder adhering to the surface in the rice polishing process are thoroughly removed .
this is called rice washing .
rice for producing futsushu is washed in large quantity at a time using machines .
on the other hand , rice used for producing high-class sake is manually washed in a quantity of approximately ten kilograms using cold water with a temperature of around five degrees centigrade utilizing water pressure of flowing water .
even while washing rice , rice begins to absorb moisture and this step requires utmost attention as seen from the fact that it is called the &quot; second rice washing stage . &quot;
rice washed in such way is sent to a soaking process .
washed rice is soaked in water and made to absorb moisture .
this step is called soaking ( in Japanese , &quot; shinseki &quot; or &quot; shinsi &quot; ) .
soaking is a step used to make moisture penetrate throughout the whole rice grain so that steamed rice should not have any unevenness .
when water has penetrated from the outside of a rice grain into the central structure of sakamai ( rice for brewing sake ) where starch content is high ( according to the language of toji and other workers in brewery &quot; mentama &quot; ( literally , &quot; eyeball &quot; ) , the rice grain become literally transparent .
the time required for soaking differs subtly depending on various conditions such as the method of rice polishing , as well as weather , air temperature , humidity and water temperature of the day .
it is manual work that is carried out in the coldest part of the year .
the taste of produced sake remarkably differs depending upon to what degree rice has absorbed water .
the time used for soaking widely ranges from several minutes to several hours depending upon the variety of rice and the targeted quality of sake .
the higher the rice-polishing ratio is , the more the difference influences the results , the soaking time is controlled very strictly on the second time scale using a stop watch especially in the case of high-class sake .
as rice continues absorbing water even after having been removed from the water , the soaking time is determined taking such time into consideration .
depending upon the concept for quality of produced sake , rice is made to absorb water for a limited time by intentionally taking it out of the water .
such way is called &quot; gentei kyusui &quot; ( literally , limited water absorption ) .
after soaking , rice is spread to maintain humidity .
even during this time , rice continues absorbing moisture .
after that , rice is steamed so that the rice starch will be easily decomposed by the koji enzyme .
this step is officially called &quot; jokyo &quot; ( &quot; kyo &quot; is composed of a left radical &quot; 食 &quot; ( eating or food ) and a right radical &quot; 強 &quot; ( strong ) , or &quot; mushi &quot; ( steaming ) by the language of toji .
for futsushu , rice is steamed with a machine called an automatic rice steamer .
for high-class sake , rice is put into a large-sized steamer called &quot; koshiki &quot; that is placed on a Japanese-style pot and steamed with dry steam for approximately one hour .
steamed rice is judged good if it is &quot; gaiko nainan &quot; ( literally , hard outside and soft inside ) , in other words , the outside is dried out and the inside soft .
the reasons are ; if the outside is melted , there is a risk of decomposition before koji aspergillus settles down and , if the inside of rice is half-cooked , the part where the best quality starch is included may not be saccharized and fermented .
the action to remove the koshiki from the pot is called &quot; koshikidaoshi &quot; ( literally , toppling down koshiki ) .
it means not only completion of steaming , but also , for toji and other workers in the brewery , the end of the season for sake brewing , during which they are not allowed to relax their attention , has come to the end and the arrival of the day when they can give themselves a break .
koji is produced by sprinkling koji mold spores , namely aspergillus onto steamed rice to breed them and it works to carry out the conversion of the starch in rice into glucose , namely carries out saccharification . ( for more information , refer to &quot; Koji . &quot; )
officially , the step koji production is called &quot; seigiku &quot; in the Japanese language .
other than sake in the initial stage in which sake was brewed as kuchikami-no-sake ( sake by mouth-chewing ) and kabi-no-sake ( literally , sake from mold ) , sake brewing using koji was established by the beginning of the Nara period .
for a long time since , until the Muromachi period , koji production was operated by specialists who were independent from sake traders because of its importance for the process of sake brewing and the supply and demand for other foodstuffs such as miso and soy sauce .
because of the Bunan koji disturbance in 1444 , koji production was forced to merge by military force as a part of sake trading ( Refer to &quot; History of Sake - Muromachi period ) .
in most sake breweries , there is a special room called &quot; kojimuro &quot; ( literally , chamber for koji ) where koji production is carried out .
the temperature is kept at around thirty degrees centigrade and the humidity not higher than sixty percent by means of floor panel heating or air conditioning .
the high temperature is necessary for yellow koji aspergillus to be cultivated .
with respect to humidity , the reason is because , if the humidity is higher , mold other than yellow koji aspergillus as well as other bacteria , may propagate .
to enter the room , whole body sterilization is required and none other than people concerned are allowed to enter the room .
in addition , to prevent sundry bacteria to enter from the outside of the room , the room is made carefully by investing a certain amount of capital for double doors , sealable windows , adiabatic walls , etc .
often , it is said &quot; kojimuro is a precious property of brewery . &quot;
as described in details in the section &quot; Koji , &quot; koji produces proteolytic enzyme and so on , in addition to amylolytic enzyme for saccharification , and they melt rice and determine the quality and taste of sake .
as the target quality of sake cannot be obtained if too much enzyme is produced , it is necessary to produce koji in such a way that the degree of melting rice stops at the appropriate point .
in order to judge it , haze , that occurs in several positions on rice , is focused on .
the action of yeast elongating bacterial threads into steamed rice like a plant elongates its roots into the ground is called hazekomi and the conditions of hazekomi is called hazekomi conditions .
koji is classified as follows by hazekomi conditions . :
the condition in which bacterial threads of yeast do not cover the whole surface of steamed rice and the portions with haze and other portions are clearly separated and bacterial threads are elongated intruding firmly and deeply into the inside of steamed rice
koji with ideal conditions having strong power for saccharification and appropriate protelolytic ability is obtained gives clear and smooth , elegant sake quality , it is used for ginjoshu as a general tendency .
the condition in which bacterial threads of yeast cover the whole surface of steamed rice and bacterial threads have intruded inside .
it has a powerful strength for saccharification and proteolytic ability and , depending on the quantity of used koji , it tends to result in sake with various tastes obtained .
as produced sake has deep flavor and tasteful quality , it is preferred for producing junmaishu ( sake made without added alcohol or sugar )
the condition in which bacterial threads of yeast cover the whole surface of steamed rice , but bacterial threads have not intruded deep inside
both the power for saccharification and proteolytic ability are weak and its ratio of lees is high and it tends to result in weak sake .
condition in which koji is in a mushy state as the steamed rice is too soft and bacterial threads intrude too much into both the surface and the inside because of an error in adjustment during the preceding step when steaming rice .
under such conditions , there is a risk that koji has been contaminated by various bacteria .
generally speaking , it cannot be used for sake brewing .
among toji and other workers in a brewery , it is said &quot; First , koji . second , moto ( sake mash ) , and Third , tsukuri &quot; ( preparation ) .
in sake brewing , great importance is attached to koji as the basis for sake brewing as certain toji and other workers in a brewery who say &quot; If we can obtain good koji , sake is seventy percent made . &quot;
as a guide , a space of approximately 3.3 square meters is needed for 30 kg of steamed rice and , for daiginjoshu or junmai daiginjoshu , approximately 5 g of yellow aspergillus is sprinkled on 100 kg of steamed rice .
depending on the target sake quality , a method for producing koji is chosen from the following :
Futa koji method is a method used mainly for ginjoshu or higher quality .
time needed to produce koji is not shorter than two days , approximately fifty hours and the process is carried out in the following order :
&quot; Tanekiri &quot; - In this process , steamed rice , which is as warm as approximately thirty-five degrees centigrade is spread and seed koji , namely powder-like yellow aspergillus is sprinkled using a sieve .
after sprinkling , rice is gathered in the center forming a big bun-like shape and wrap with a cloth .
&quot; kirikaeshi &quot; - After eight to nine hours has elapsed from &quot; Tanekiri , &quot; the rice has become hard because moisture has evaporated from heat generated by the breeding yellow aspergillus .
rice is spread once to diffuse the heat and , then , it is gathered in the form of a big bun and wrapped again .
&quot; Mori &quot; ( literally , &quot; filling &quot; ) - From around the next day , yellow aspergillus become active and the rise of the temperature of rice is remarkable .
then , the big bun is loosened and rice is put into small boxes in small quantity and such boxes are stacked in predetermined space and controlled .
this small box is called &quot; kojibuta &quot; and since rice fills the kojibuta , this process is called &quot; mori ( literally , &quot; filling &quot; ) . &quot;
in the case of non-ginjo sake , kojibuta is not used in may cases .
&quot; tsumikae &quot; ( literally , &quot; re-stacking &quot; ) - In three to four hours after mori , heat is accumulated in rice again and the order of stacking of kojibuta is changed to lower the temperature .
&quot; nakashigoto &quot; ( literally , &quot; intermediate work &quot; ) - In order to disperse heat again , rice is spread and its temperature is lowered .
&quot; shimaishigoto &quot; ( literally , &quot; final work &quot; ) - In order to further disperse heat , rice is spread and its temperature is lowered .
this process is called shimaishigoto meaning that it is the final work to disperse heat of rice , but , in fact , it is not final .
&quot; Saiko tsumikae &quot; - Even after shimaishigoto the temperature of rice continues to increase .
when the temperature reaches its maximum , the order of stacking kojibuta is changed for final temperature adjustment .
as it is carried out when the temperature reaches the maximum ( &quot; saiko &quot; in Japanese ) , it is called saiko tsumikae .
even after this , work to lower the temperature by appropriately changing the order of stacking is continued in order to check the temperature of the rice several times .
&quot; Dekoji &quot; ( literally , &quot; taking out koji &quot; ) - After around fifty hours have elapsed , a fragrant flavor like that of roasted chestnuts comes out .
this is the sign of completion of koji manufacturing .
such condition is reached , koji is removed from kojimuro .
Hako koji method is a technique in which the procedures of &quot; 3 . Mori &quot; and after that in futa koji method are simplified and it is used for sake quality centering on futsushu .
rice is separated into small lots using kojibako , that is bigger than kojibuta , and amount of rice that can be processed at a time increases because the kojibako is bigger , resulting in decrease in required labor and lowering of costs .
the Toko koji method is a method where no kojibuta or kojibako is used , but heat of rice is dispersed on kojidoko ( a board on which yellow aspergillus is sprinkled onto rice ) .
it is used for sake quality centering on futsushu .
Kikai seigikuho is a method to produce koji in a large lot using machines .
it requires less labor enabling to keep manufacturing cost at a low level , but , as there are certain limits for producing quality sake , it is understood as not suitable for high-class sake .
it is used for sake quality centering on futsushu .
this is a process for increasing sake yeast .
according to the language of toji and other workers in a brewery it is also called &quot; motodate . &quot;
although yeast has the function to change glucose into alcohol ( namely , the action of fermentation ) , in order to make rice ferment in such large amounts that are handled in a brewery , one or two yeasts , that are microorganisms , are quite insufficient and yeasts in the order of several tens or hundreds of billions are required corresponding to the amount of rice .
in reality , however , the number of yeasts is not calculated one by one , but as a unit called &quot; cell . &quot;
under the circumstances , breweries are obliged to breed a small quantity of Kyokai sake yeast in a large amount under specific environmental conditions .
yeasts bred in such large quantities are called sake mash ( in Japanese , &quot; shubo &quot; or &quot; moto &quot; ) .
the work begins with a process to put koji and cold water into a tub or a tank , which is called motooke , about one meter high and mixing them well .
then , interim product called mizukoji ( literally , water-like koji ) is obtained .
recently , motooke made of high-quality stainless steel is mainly used and , although it looks like a &quot; tank , &quot; it is called &quot; motooke &quot; as a piece of equipment used for sake brewing .
brewing lactic acid and a small quantity of adopted yeast are added to mizukoji .
usually , only one type of yeast , which is considered best suiting the sake quality targeted by the sake manufacturer , is chosen from various sake yeasts .
in a such case as the yeast chosen has overly unique characteristics , however , it is often blended with another type of yeast to dilute it .
by adding steamed rice to the above-mentioned interim product , the preparation of sake mash-making is complete .
depending upon the production method , it is left for a period from two weeks to one month as it is and a large quantity of yeast is bred in the tub used for the preparation and the production of sake mash , or moto is completed .
places used for sake mash-making are called shuboshitsu ( literally , chamber of sake mash ) or motoba ( literally , place of sake mash ) and the room temperature is kept around five degrees Celsius so that no undesirable bacteria or natural yeast will enter .
compared to kojimuro , however , as strict control is not required , certain breweries allow visitors to enter .
in shuboshitsu , a unique sound produced by the yeast is heard .
during sake mash-making , as the cover of the tank is left open , a lot of undesirable bacteria or natural yeast in the air easily enter into the tank .
therefore , it becomes necessary to kill or get rid of undesirable bacteria or natural yeast by adding nitrate reducing bacteria or lactobacillus in order to produce lactic acid .
depending upon the way of adding lactic acid , sake mash-making is classified into two methods , the kimoto-kei ( Kimoto system ) and the Sokujo-kei ( Sokujo system ) .
at present , sake mash-making of the kimoto-kei is classified into two methods , Kimoto and Yamahaimoto .
kimoto is the oldest method among those used today and it takes lactobacillus from the air and allows it to produce lactic acid to get rid of undesirable bacteria and natural yeast .
it takes approximately one month until sake mash is obtained .
the reasons for the long period required for this process are the many steps requiring much labor and fermentation which is carried out completely .
even today , there is a tendency to hesitate to use this method because the amount of time and labor required .
however , the number of breweries that pursue the revival of tradition has been increasing because reliable sake quality is obtained when they succeed .
the main steps of this process are as follows :
rice , koji , and water are put into a tub ( tank ) .- &gt; Yamaoroshi - &gt; Temperature control - &gt; Adding yeast - &gt; Temperature control - &gt; Sake mash-making completed
however , as the risk of putrefaction or acidification is large , the National Research Institute of Brewing ( presently the National Research Institute of Brewing - NRIB ) developed Yamahaimoto in 1909 .
refer to the next section .
yamahaimoto is an abbreviation of Yamaororoshi-haishi-moto that means a method of preparation that belongs to the Kimoto-kei .
sake which is brewed with this method is called Yamahai-shikomi ( or -jikomi ) or simply Yamahai .
roughly speaking , it is a process in which the step of yamaoroshi is excluded from the kimotozukuri .
however , it is not just the exclusion of yamaoroshi , but also there are other differences in many minor respects .
&quot; yamaoroshi &quot; means working to mix rice , koji and water using an oar-like tool and it is also called &quot; Motosuri . &quot;
for more information , refer to &quot; Yamahaishikomi &quot; and &quot; the Relationship between Kimoto , Yamahai , and Sokujomoto . &quot;
sokujo-kei is a modern method of adding lactic acid artificially in advance .
it was devised in 1910 .
it is carried out by adding brewing lactic acid to water for preparation and , after mixing well , kakemai and koji are added .
it is also called sokujomoto .
the time required is approximately two weeks .
most sake produced today is sokujo-kei .
the process is as follows :
rice , koji , water and lactic acid are mixed . - &gt; Adding yeast - &gt; Temperature control - &gt; Sake mash-making completed .
moromi is a white-colored turbid bubbling thick liquid composed of perfectly blended sake mash , koji and steamed rice in a tank used for preparation .
as a supplement not academic or professional , but for helping the general understanding , limited to the context related to the production method for sake , &quot; moromi , &quot; &quot; shikomi &quot; and &quot; tsukuri &quot; are often used meaning the same .
therefore , &quot; moromizukuri &quot; is also called simply &quot; tsukuri . &quot;
when we say &quot; First &apos; koji , &apos; second &apos; moto , &apos; and third &apos; tsukuri &apos; , &quot; &quot; tsukuri &quot; is used for this meaning .
on the other hand , the place for conducing tsukuri is called shikomiba ( place for preparation ) .
in most shikomiba today , tanks for three-stage preparation equipped with a temperature sensor , stand one after another .
in the process of moromi zukuri , moromi produces alcohol from the action of yeast and , at the same time , starch is changed into sugar by koji .
this simultaneous change is called parallel multiple fermentation which is unique to sake brewing .
in preparation , steamed rice and koji are added in three steps .
this is dan-jikomi ( stage-wise preparation ) or sandan-jikomi ( three-stage preparation ) which is described in records from the Muromachi period , &quot; Goshu no nikki ( Diary of sake ) . &quot;
with this method , as fermentation is carried out without spoiling the activity of the yeast , alcohol exceeding a concentration of over twenty percent is produced near the end of moromi making .
this is exceptionally high alcohol concentration for brewing and is a unique method used only for sake that we can call of a technical heritage which we can be proud of .
the first stage is called &quot; hatsuzoe &quot; ( literally , &quot; first adding &quot; ) ( abbreviated as &quot; soe &quot; ) .
the second stage , after one day interval called odori ( literally , &quot; dancing &quot; ) , is called nakazoe ( literally , &quot; intermediate adding &quot; ) ( abbreviated as &quot; naka &quot; ) .
the third stage is called &quot; tomezoe &quot; ( literally , &quot; stopping adding &quot; ) ( abbreviated as &quot; tome &quot; ) .
fermentation is carried out over twenty to thirty days .
ways of producing ginjo system ( ginjoshu , junmai ginjoshu , daiginjoshu and junmai daiginjoshu ) and non-ginjo system ( other than above-mentioned ) sake differ in the following two points in this stage .
rice-polishing ratio
rice polishing is conducted to remove protein contained in rice .
since protein plays an important role in the composition of an organism , moromi produced from kojimai and kakemai with a high rice-polishing ratio is not a good environment for yeast to live .
therefore , in order to survive under such an environment , yeast generates , by itself , organic acids such as amino acid , citric acid and malic acid .
among such organic acids , volatile ones compose unique ginjoko .
the more the rice is scraped , the more ginjoko yeast is produced , resulting from its agony .
temperature control
heat is radiated both when yeast obtains energy from glucose sugar and when yeast creates , by itself , an environment suitable for its survival .
such heat influences chemical ingredients in moromi , in particular organic acids and generates ingredients that cause zatsumi .
on the other hand , since the main components of an organism are protein , a temperature around thirty-five degrees centigrade , which is below the coagulation temperature of protein , is suitable for most activities .
in order to suppress the generation of zatsumi , the temperature must be kept below thirty-five degrees centigrade even with release of fermentation heat .
therefore , sake brewing has been carried out during the cold season in winter .
while the heat is suppressed around fifteen degrees centigrade for usual tsukuri , it is said that around ten degrees centigrade is the target for the ginjo system in which influence on organic acids must be taken into consideration .
since times when no thermometer or sensor existed , toji and other workers in the brewery observed the condition of the foam on the surface of moromi and , by classifying several stages , they were able to grasp the progress of fermentation taking place inside .
the condition of forming on the surface of moromi is called jobo ( of foam ) and is shown as follows :
sujiawa ( stripe-like foam ) : foam generated in two to three days after tomezoe of dan-jikomi that looks like stripes showing the start of fermentation inside moromi .
mizuawa ( literally , watery foam ) : after two days approx. from sujiawa
white foam that looks like foam ejected from a crab &apos;s mouth .
sugar content in moromi is at its peak .
iwaawa : two more days after mizuawa
foam forming the rock-like shape
since heat is released in line with progress of fermentation , the temperature rise is most significant during this stage .
takaawa : two more days after iwaawa
one week to ten days in total after tomezoe of dan-jikomi
whole iwaawa rises .
as a chemical process , it is the situation in which fermentation is catching up to saccharification .
discrimination between bubbling yeast and non-bubbling yeast is often made whether or not takaawa is formed .
Ochiawa : after around twelve days from tomezoe
the rising of foam settles down .
as a chemical process , it is a situation whereby fermentation has caught up saccharification .
tamaawa : after two more days and after approximately two weeks in total from tomezoe
in more detail , it is classified into large tamaawa - &gt; middle tamaawa - &gt; small tamaawa .
foam forms the shape of a ball and become smaller and smaller .
the smaller the foam is , the more the fermentation has settled down .
Ji : after five more days , or close to three weeks after tomezoe
tamaawa becomes the smallest and , then , disappears .
it shows that fermentation is close to its end .
it is left to toji &apos;s discretion as to which stages it should be judged that whole process of &quot; moromi production &quot; is completed
for certain types of sake quality targeted , it is better to leave moromi as it is for several days more and , especially for sake in the ginjo system , it is preferable to maintain such conditions further .
in recent years , a number of non-bubbling yeasts have been developed
even today , however , during sake brewing using bubbling yeast , the above-described process of appearance can be seen in the tank .
within the period from approximately two days before joso ( a stage to squeeze sake out of moromi ) to two hours before , distilled alcohol diluted to approximately thirty percent is added slowly and carefully .
from the impression of the term &quot; adding alcohol &quot; or &quot; aruten &quot; in short form , it gives often an impression that certain impurity is added industrially ( Refer to &quot; Oishinbo &quot; in this article . ) , but it is a traditional process that goes back to hashira-shochu during the Edo period .
it has the following purposes .
effect of preservation from putrefaction : hashira-shochu during the Edo period , the origin of the process of adding alcohol at present , was a technique of adding shochu to sake to keep sake from putrefaction .
in the past , the most important purpose of the process to add alcohol was preservation from putrefaction .
today , because of progress in sanitation technique , process of adding alcohol is no longer necessary for preservation .
adjustment of flavor : this is the first reason for adding alcohol today .
the appropriate addition of alcohol draws out fragrance that lurks in unprocessed sake obtained for moromi ..
in particular , many ingredients used for fragrance in sake in the ginjo system are insoluble in water and addition of alcohol is necessary for dissolving them .
ginjoshu itself is a type of sake that has been developed on the premise of adding alcohol . ( refer to &quot; Nihonshu no Rekishi - Ginjoshu no Tanjo &quot; - literally , &quot; History of Sake - Birth of Ginjoshu &quot; . )
at present , majority of sake breweries producing ginjoshu consider that it is fundamental to add alcohol .
lightening the taste : this is the second purpose for adding alcohol today . :
moromi contains a lot of sugars and acids generated in the process of fermentation and , it they are left as they are , the final sake has a heavy taste , if we speak favorably of it , or dull taste if we speak unfavorably of it .
if alcohol is added at this stage , the flavor can be adjusted .
in particular , junmaishu leaves a sour taste more or less after drinking it because of its nature .
the sour taste is suppressed by adding alcohol and the taste becomes more mellow .
with the eating habits of today , umami , fat and oil are used very much and , therefore , a light taste is required for drinks .
therefore , the addition of alcohol is used to improve taste of sake .
increasing volume : in the age where sanbai zojo seishu ( literally , three-time increased sake ) was in full flower , alcohol adding was carried out often in order to increase the amount of sake .
by way of excuse , some say that the reason why the process of &quot; aruten &quot; presents a generally negative image is mainly because of the negative legacy from the past age .
on the other hand , some say that &quot; aruten &quot; increases the unfavorable smell of sake .
in some cases , &quot; adjustment of the fragrance &quot; and &quot; lightening of the taste &quot; are just stated reasons and the true purpose is to &quot; increase the amount . &quot;
as it gives a negative impression to say that the purpose is to increase the amount of sake , they keep it quiet .
joso is a process to squeeze namazake ( raw sake ) out of moromi .
when the toji judges that moromi has &quot; matured , &quot; alcohol and auxiliary materials are added to it .
such moromi is squeezed to separate the solids such as polished rice and malted rice , and liquid which becomes namazake .
in the language of toji and other workers in the brewery , it is also called &quot; shibori &quot; or &quot; agefune . &quot;
the solids are transformed into sakekasu ( sake lees ) .
the ratio of sakekasu to polished rice as raw material is called kasubuai ( literally , ratio of sake lees ) .
the place where joso is conducted is called &quot; josoba &quot; and futsushu , honjozoshu and junmaishu are squeezed out using a moromi automatic squeezer or centrifuge separator .
sake , where special care is required , such as ginjoshu , is squeezed using traditional methods such as funeshibori , yabutashibori and fukurozuri .
it is not only to create the atmosphere of handmade products .
as ginjoshu moromi contains more undissolved rice than moromi for other types of sake , sakekasu clogs the machine .
the opening from which sake that has been squeezed comes out is called funakuchi .
in breweries , when joso of the first sake of the year is conducted , a sugitama ( a large ornamental ball made with cedar leaves ) or sakabayashi is hung in the space under the eaves to announce that new sake has been produced .
the sugitama , when newly hung , looks fresh and green , but its color changes to brown as it runs dry .
such change in color of the sugitama plays a role of a sign to signal the status of storage and maturing of new sake in the brewery .
orisage means to wait in order to remove turbidness of the sake that just came out from the process of joso .
sake just squeezed out from the funakuchi often still contains carbon dioxide gas and it has a turbid golden color in which yeast , particles of starch , protein , polysaccharide and so on are suspended .
ingredients causing such turbidness are called ori and sake is left in the tank as it is for a while in order to let them precipitate .
effects of orisage is not only to remove turbidness , but also to remove excess protein to prevent turbidness because of denaturation of protein caused by the change in temperature and aging after bottling .
it also lessens the load of the filtration in the following process .
the clear upper portion after orisage is called &quot; namashu . &quot;
as &quot; namashu &quot; is a different concept from &quot; namazake , &quot; we have to be careful in this regard .
excluding cases where completed sake should be prepared as &quot; namazake &quot; or &quot; murokashu &quot; ( literally , &quot; non-filtered sake &quot; ) , orisage is conducted usually twice between joso and shipments for most of the usual types of sake .
even after the first orisage , usually , namashu still contains lees such as yeast and particles of starch .
therefore , it also contains zatsumi and the process of filtration becomes necessary to filter them out .
in recent years , in line with the tendency of the orientation for &quot; nama &quot; ( raw ) by consumers , some breweries deliver sake as unfiltered raw unprocessed sake without conducting process from orisage and thereafter .
filtration means to remove minute lees still remaining in namashu after orisage and zatsumi .
also , one purpose is to change the color from golden color to colorless transparent status as much as possible .
there are many cases where sake is shipped out as murokashu omitting this process intentionally .
filtration with active charcoal : filtration conducted by introducing powdered active charcoal is called filtration with carbon or filtration with active charcoal .
powdered active charcoal is called simply &quot; sumi &quot; ( charcoal ) in the brewery .
basically , it is same as charcoal contained in deodorizers for home-use refrigerators or black powder in cigarette filters .
as a guide , one kilogram of charcoal is thrown in for one kiloliter of namashu and the charcoal adsorbs the impurities , color , and precipitate .
after that , charcoal is removed together with the impurities .
although we say &quot; throw &quot; in active charcoal , it is not just thrown in and the difficult part of this process is to remove only those impurities and colors that should be removed .
if we put in too much active charcoal , the sake becomes clear , but the taste , color and fragrance are lost and the sake produced will have no character .
in reality , the higher the class of sake , the smaller the amount of charcoal used and , for choice sake for which stable consumers exist , it is only around 0.06 kg ..
thus , as the amount of charcoal is very critical , a large number of specialists only for this process called sumiya ( literally , specialist for charcoal ) existed in places where jizake ( local sake ) is brewed
however , filtration with active charcoal itself is now a technique of the past , and recently the amount of active charcoal used , the frequency with which it is used , and the number of charcoal specialists ( known as sumiya ) have been on the decline .
in addition , as sake is often filtered using other methods after it has been filtered using active charcoal , the &quot; use of active charcoal &quot; and &quot; filtration &quot; are processes that are on totally different levels .
filtration with diatomaceous earth : this process carries out filtration using a layer of diatomaceous earth to remove impurities and , if it is carried out after filtration with active charcoal , the active charcoal itself .
diatomaceous earth is composed of porous fossil remains of diatoms and it removes substances that cause coloring , zatsumi and fragrance to a certain degree .
progress made in this filtration technique is one of reasons for the decrease in the use of active charcoal .
filtration with filter paper : in certain cases , filter paper is used for filtration .
filtration with a filter : recently , it has become significantly popular .
method using a cartridge type filter .
cartridge type filters can be replaced and , therefore , are simple and convenient .
in particular for sake to be shipped out as namazake ( raw sake ) , because hiire ( pasteurization ) as a measure against hiochi bacteria is not done , filtration for removing bacteria with high precision ( in the order of 0.22 to 0.65 μ ) is carried out with this method .
most sake just came out from funakuchi has beautiful golden color like ears of rice in autumn .
in certain periods in the past , points were deducted for sake that has color in Zenkoku Shinshu Kanpyokai ( National New Sake Appraising and Deliberating Fair ) .
as a matter of course , most breweries removed color by filtration with active charcoal and delivered sake which is clear and colorless like water .
we can say that clear and colorless tone which is associated generally with the word &quot; seishu &quot; ( literally , clear sake ) is a reminder of such an age .
at present , apart from zatsumi and unfavorable smell , it is not necessary to remove color , sake that is distributed without removing color has been revived and the number of consumers who like the naiveness of sake with natural color has been increasing .
under such situations , it is worth taking notice about the future of sake filtration .
hiire means to heat brewed sake for the purpose of pasteurization .
it is also called &quot; hiate . &quot;
in sake before hiire , yeast is still alive and acting .
enzymes generated by koji also maintains its activity and , therefore , sake quality tends to change .
also , hiochikin , which is a kind of lactic acid bacterium , might be included .
if hiochi bacteria are left as they are , sake will become clouded ( hiochi ) .
therefore , hiire is conducted to sterilize or make lose active yeast , enzyme , and hiochi bacteria and to stabilize sake quality .
through this processing , it becomes possible to store sake for a long period at a natural temperature .
if heating is conducted excessively , however , alcohol and volatile ingredients that give fragrance are evaporated and sake quality is spoiled .
therefore , this process is also difficult .
currently , this process is usually carried out with temperature sixty-two to sixty-eight degrees centigrade .
the hiire technique was already described in &quot; Goshu no Nikki &quot; ( literally , &quot; diary of sake &quot; ) , which is the technical guidebook for sake brewing written during the Muromachi period and we can know that this technique was used since the medieval times in the area centering on the Kinai region ( provinces surrounding Kyoto and Nara ) .
this means that , even 500 years before discovery of the pasteurizing temperature in 1862 by Louis Pasteur , who is called the father of bacteriology in the West , it was generally conducted in sake brewing in Japan .
Atkinson , who was a British and came to Japan in the early part of the Meiji period , visited sake breweries in various places in 1881 and observed the practice in which temperature control was conducted very accurately without using thermometer telling that the condition in which &quot; the character &quot; の &quot; can just be written on the surface of sake &quot; shows the appropriate temperature ( approximately 130 degrees Centigrade or 55 degrees Fahrenheit ) and he recorded this fact showing his astonishment .
sake which does not undergo hiire is popular as &quot; namazake &quot; or &quot; non-filtered raw unprocessed sake . &quot;
sake belonging to such &quot; nama &quot; ( literally , raw ) group really gives a fresh feeling and its fragrance is also felt to be young and glamorous and remaining slight sparkling feeling goes down smoothly giving sake certain value as a commodity .
however , almost all of following images that are generally common are wrong .
as namazake has not undergone hiire , freshness is preserved accordingly .
hiire is a process that cause sake to lose it &apos;s youth .
namazake gives the taste of new sake which has been just squeezed and can be enjoyed in the brewery .
if hiire is not conducted , sake deteriorates very quickly , and soon generates namahineka .
in many catering establishments where correct preservation control is not conducted , deteriorated sake is often served at low temperature around five degrees centigrade so that deterioration is not noticed because of coldness .
therefore , some say that hiire is a process to keep the freshness of sake for a long time .
the taste of sake which belongs to &quot; nama &quot; group is somehow harsh and lacks umami and profoundness which sake that undergoes storage and maturing gives .
therefore , roughly speaking , hard-core regular drinkers tend to prefer generally sake that has undergone the hiire process .
in many cases , however , as &quot; namazake &quot; which is not stored under proper control is consumed , sake undergoes hiire for easier preferred storage control .
it is true that sake loses delicacy from the hiire process and we should not forget that sake that has not undergone hiire , as long as it is properly stored , has a flavor that sake that has undergone hiire cannot have .
in Japan where &quot; nama &quot; ( raw or fresh ) represented by sashimi is favored , freshness is especially favored .
the sake industry in Japan tends to be influenced by the beer industry which increased their turnover with &quot; nama &quot; ( not pasteurized ) and &quot; karakuchi &quot; ( dry ) .
because of such factors , with respect to sake also , the number of products described as &quot; nama &quot; has been increasing since the 1980s .
many sake commentators speak of the &quot; namazake boom &quot; and there is a knowledgeable person who brought up the difficulties in concrete form with regard to the recent stagnation in sake consumption .
excluding the cases where sake is produced as namachozoshu ( literally , raw-stored sake ) or namazumeshu ( literally , raw bottled sake ) , for most of common sake , hiire has been carried out twice between joso and the shipment .
the first hiire is carried out before storage for maturing and the second hiire immediately before bottling for shipment .
the first hiire makes ingredients settle down and determines how mature the sake is during storage .
this can be charted for easy reference as follows :
joso - &gt; first orisage - &gt; first filtration - &gt; first hiire - &gt; storage and maturing - &gt; second orisage - &gt; second filtration - &gt; warimizu ( literally , dilution with water ) - &gt; second hiire - &gt; bottling - &gt; shipment
namachozoshu : no first hiire conducted
in the language of toji and other workers in breweries , &quot; sakinama &quot; or &quot; namacho &quot;
namazumeshu : no second hiire conducted
in languages of toji and other workers in breweries , &quot; atonama &quot;
namazake : no first and second hiire conducted
in languages of toji and other workers in breweries , &quot; namanama &quot; or &quot; honnama &quot;
namashu : the clear upper portion after orisage
based on the above-described premises , there is an opinion that as namachozoshu or namazumeshu undergoes hiire at least once and literally not &quot; nama , &quot; it is not appropriate to include the word &quot; name &quot; in the name .
also , certain breweries take advantage of consumers &apos; mindset favoring &quot; nama &quot; by printing the character &quot; nama &quot; in namachozoshu or namazumeshu in large size or with eye-catching color on the label adding other characters in small size to create the image of &quot; nama &quot; sake for namachozoshu or namazumeshu .
there was a knowledgeable person who pointed out that if such tendency goes too far , it constitutes false labeling .
on the other hand , some ginjoshu and junmaishu are distributed as real namazake , namely &quot; namanama , just labeled as &quot; namazume &quot; ( literally , bottled raw ) .
in certain eating and drinking establishments in which sake is served such as an izakaya ( Japanese-style pub ) , we see rather often that , although they do not sell real namazake , but only namachozoshu or namazumeshu , write &quot; namazake &quot; on their menus or posters .
for namazake , costs for storage and distribution are high and , therefore , the selling price becomes higher accordingly .
therefore , if the price equivalent to namachozoshu or namazumeshu is shown on the menu , consumers misunderstand it as &quot; comparatively low in price . &quot;
because such way constitutes a real disguised presentation , consumers can point it out without hesitation .
maturing means the course of growth or completion of sake quality that progresses during storage .
after joso and orisage , some sake is shipped without filtration or hiire as murokashu ( non-filtered sake ) or namazake .
other sake , after being processed with such steps , is usually stored for a while in order to draw out umami , mellowness and deep taste .
ginjo or higher quality sake is often given a maturing period of a half year or more in order to stabilize its fragrance and flavor .
from the feeling that the indication of shinshu ( literally , new sake ) , koshu ( old sake ) , hizoshu ( treasured sake ) , etc. is not suitable for the status of ginjoshu even in such case an indication is not usually printed on the label .
even for non-ginjoshu , certain honjozoshu and junmaishu are stored for a long period for the purpose of maturing due to various reasons , such as natural conditions of the place where the brewery is located , features of the local water , and the concept which the toji aimed at .
in sake that has not undergone the process of hiire , fermentation has not yet stopped and chojukusayo ( literally , maturing adjusting effect ) , in other words natural adjustment of the flavor by degrading the amino acid and saccharization still continues .
therefore , for brands for which characteristic taste is finally created by chojukusayo , it is a part of the indispensable process not to ship immediately , but to store until the sake matures .
generally speaking , for junmaishu which has been totally fermented , maturing progresses slowly and degradation does not easily occur .
for sake which has not totally fermented , it is said that , it has a lot of the ingredients which have not been degraded to alcohol , change in sake quality is quick and tends to become degraded .
causes of maturing can be classified roughly into physical factors such as heat and enzymes from the outside and chemical factors which occurs inside , such as nitrogen oxide like amino acids and aldehyde .
however , with respect to this detailed theory , there are many unsolved questions .
for example , there are many cases in which storage is conducted in specific places such as in an abandoned mine or tunnel of dead track and the obtained taste is mellower than that of sake stored in other places even if conditions such as temperature and humidity are kept scientifically the same .
one example is the Kurokicho Tunnel which is used jointly by sixteen breweries that are members of Fukuoka Meishukai .
it has not been clarified what it is in the tunnel that works on favorable maturing .
as freshness is very important to sake , the same as with milk , it is generally said that , regarding the problems of &quot; namazake , &quot; even for sake that has undergone hiire , it is better to drink it as soon as possible after shipment .
in reality , however , this is mainly the opinion of the breweries .
most sake commentators who are engaged in writing activities keeping close contact with kuramoto ( sake brewers ) take such position .
on the other hand there are many persons on distribution , selling , and on the consumer side who insist that , if not opened , most sake can be matured easily after purchase , in their hand .
the reason why sake breweries provide a period for maturing before shipment while advising to &quot; drink &quot; as soon as possible , &quot; is that they ship sake when the sake quality reaches the optimum taste after a certain time period for storage required for maturing .
apart from the risk of putrefaction , breweries want consumers to &quot; drink as soon as possible after shipment , &quot; to have consumers taste the concept the brewery intended .
sometimes , however , the concept intended by the brewery does not necessarily fit the taste of the consumers , particularly experienced drinkers .
in such cases , there may be a case in which sake becomes more tasty after storing and maturing at home .
to speak in plain language , it is like the cook serves certain dish saying &quot; Please try this without adding any seasoning . &quot; but gourmet tries a small portion and says &quot; For me , it is better this way . &quot; and squeezes yuzu ( Citrus junos ) on it or spices it up further .
in places where local basic food is eaten after storage and maturing for a certain amount of time like funazushi ( fermented crucian carp sushi ) in Shiga Prefecture , there is sake which is brewed using the same amount of time needed for maturing food to complete the sake quality .
namely , food and sake are prepared at the same time and eaten at the same time after certain period .
such maturing shows the original point of local sake , namely the relation to supplement each other with food underlying in the food culture .
for sake , the brewing year begins from July , every year , and ends in June the next year and , usually , sake shipped within the brewing year is called shinshu .
recently , however , there is some confusion about the definition of shinshu because of the increase of sake which is shipped before June without waiting for the autumn in the year of joso labeling it as &quot; shinshu &quot; to discriminate with hiyaoroshi ( refer to definition below ) .
with respect to koshu , also , no clear definition has been established as some sake commentators take the position that &quot; Below five years , it cannot be acknowledged as koshu . &quot;
some sake breweries have introduced the concept of vintage for wine in the West to sake , and display the year of production of sake on the label .
for sake made with such a vintage system the taste becomes deeper by maturing , the period of maturing is as long as twenty to thirty years .
hiyaoroshi is sake brewed in winter and stored and matured in a cool sake storehouse in spring and summer and bottled and shipped in autumn when air temperature is low .
as such sake is sold wholesale ( oroshi or oroshiuri in Japanese ) without conducting hiire ( wholesale of sake in cold status ) , such a name came into existence .
based on the fact that it is shipped one year after being brewed , it should be classified as koshu , but it is treated customarily as a type of shinshu .
at present , there is no clear definition of the word &quot; daikoshu ( or okoshu ) . &quot;
generally speaking , however , incommensurable maturing , suitable for using the word &quot; dai &quot; ( great ) , is required .
aged sake , stored over 100 years is generally called daikoshu , needless to mention about 279 years of daikoshu from the Genroku period opened in 1968 .
warimizu means adding water , to be more precise , shuzo yosui to sake , that was taken out of the storage tank used for storing and maturing , immediately before shipment .
it is also called &quot; kasuichosei &quot; ( literally , adjustment by adding water ) or &quot; kasui &quot; ( literally , water adding )
in the process of producing shochu , the exactly same operation is called &quot; wasui . &quot;
the purpose of this operation is to decrease the alcohol concentration of sake .
immediately after moromi is produced , almost all sake has an alcohol concentration close to twenty percent because of parallel multiple fermentation .
because the higher the alcohol concentration is , the less the possibility of putrefaction , storage and maturing are carried out with an alcohol concentration close to twenty percent .
when shipping , in relation to the provisions of the Liquor Tax Act , and because that consumers prefer low alcohol-concentration , it is necessary to lower the alcohol concentration to a desired level .
( refer to &quot; Sake of low alcohol concentration . &quot; )
sake shipped without warimizu at the original alcohol concentration at the time when moromi was produced is called &quot; genshu &quot; ( unprocessed sake ) ( Kasui that causes change in alcohol concentrations below one percent is allowed . )
the word unprocessed sake seems to make people imagine primary sake with moromi and yeast , the source of the sake , or thick syrupy extract-like sake , but it is not so in reality .
it is certain that , if warimizu is not done , its alcohol concentration is higher than that of usual sake .
sake , for which final adjustment such as warimizu is completed , is put into bottles which have been washed with washing water , and supplied to the distribution channel that each brewer has developed independently .
expressions related to the historical production method which is not used today are included .

as a supplement neither academic or professional , but for promoting general understanding , we can consider , limiting the context related to producing method for sake , that they are synonyms like &quot; shikomu &quot; ( to prepare ) = &quot; tsukuru ( to produce ) and &quot; shikomi &quot; ( preparation ) = &quot; tsukuri &quot; ( production ) .
which is more popular as a designation largely depends on the trend during the period and the intention of the producer .

most important classification of seishu at present is the classification by specific class name .
sake of which raw material and / or manufacturing method meets specified standards is classified into specific class name of sake , such as ginjoshu , junmai ginjoshu ( ginjo sake with no added alcohol ) , and honjozoshu ( a sake brewed with rice of polishing ratio not exceeding 70 % as main material and distilled alcohol of as auxiliary material not exceeding 10 % of rice by weight
seishu that does not correspond to specific class name sake is called futsushu ( literally , ordinary sake ) .
provisions related to rice-polishing ratios were abolished from January 1 , 2004 , however , it became possible to describe even when it does not meet the following conditions , the names are used just as a guide .
( for more information refer to the section &quot; Junmaishu . &quot; )
other than specific name , there are various classifications by characteristic raw materials or manufacturing method .
they contain those established by notification of the National Tax Agency , the Standards for Manufacturing Methods and Quality Indication for Seishu , and those which have been used traditionally and customarily by sake breweries and the industry organization .
with respect to the former , specific names and several items to be described as well as arbitrary items to be denoted and items which are prohibited from being denoted specified by the National Tax Agency .
with respect to the latter , in order to increase the value added , there are various classifications not defined in the former .
in certain cases different terms are used for the classification of the same meaning depending upon the district and generation ( example : nakadori / nakagumi etc . ) , and they are not uniform .
before the use of specific names is provided for , there existed the sake grading system of tokkyu ( special class ) , ikkyu ( first class ) and nikyu ( second class ) . ( for more information , refer to the &quot; History of Sake . &quot; )
as a ranking system unique to breweries , words such as tokusen ( literally , special selection ) , josen ( literally , higher selection ) and kasen ( literally , good selection ) .
seishu other than sake with a specific class name
most types of sake distributed generally are futsushu .
other than rice and malted rice , it is allowed to add other raw materials such as distilled alcohol , sugars , sour agents , umami-chomiryo ( chemical seasoning ) and sake lees on condition that the total weight of auxiliary materials does not exceed the weight of rice and malted rice .
three-time increased volume of sake and sake in which three-time increased sake volume is blended are also included in futsushu .
specific name sake is seishu for which polished rice of the third grade or higher and the ratio of malted rice to the weight of polished rice is fifteen percent or more .
depending upon raw materials and the rice-polishing ratio , specific name sake is classified into honjozoshu , junmaishu and ginjoshu .
honjozoshu is seishu which is produced with polished rice of a polishing ratio not exceeding seventy percent , malted rice and water and distilled alcohol and has a delicious flavor and color .
the addition of an amount of alcohol ( aruten ) not exceeding 120 liters per ton of polished rice ( the weight ratio of alcohol to rice is 1 : 10 ) is allowed .
as the concentrated alcohol added sake is too high , it is often diluted with water ( warimizu ) .
therefore , honjozoshu has less umami and sweetness and , generally speaking , its taste becomes light and simple .
junmaishu is a seishu which is produced with only polished rice , malted rice , and water .
however , such &quot; polished rice &quot; must be produced from unpolished rice which is graded to the third grade or higher or the equivalent .
it is also required that the total weight of &quot; malted rice &quot; is fifteen or more of the total weight of polished rice .
generally speaking , junmaishu has a thicker consistency compared to ginjoshu and honjozo and the uniqueness of each brewery is strong .
historically , all types of sake were junmaishu up to the beginning of the Showa period .
this is because even hashirashochu , deemed as the origin of alcohol adding , is produced from rice .
because of the insufficient supply of rice during and after the Pacific War , however , three-time increased sake volume by adding alcohol became popular and , on the other hand , ginjoshu was developed with the aim to utilize alcohol adding for improvement .
accordingly , the era , in which sake other than junmaishu was the mainstream , lasted for a long time .
in recent years , however , the preconditioned , &quot; sake produced only from rice , &quot; which was taken for granted in the past , gives a fresh image and junmaishu has been forming one of the categories in the world of sake .
with respect to provisions relating to junmaishu , since the sake grading system was abolished in 1991 , there was a provision , &quot; with a polishing ratio of seventy percent or less &quot; that was valid until December 31 , 2003 and the polishing ratio was legally regulated in order to maintain the status of the name of &quot; junmaishi . &quot;
the reason is that there was a commonplace assumption at that time that the higher the polishing ratio is , the higher the grade of sake would be .
as a part of easing of the regulations in recent years , this provision was deleted as of January 1 , 2004 , and , for sake produced only from rice , even if the polishing ratio is same as for futsushu , use of name &quot; junmaishu &quot; is allowed and the evaluation is left to the choice of the consumers .
some understood this affirmatively as an &quot; expansion of the rights of consumers &quot; and the other understood critically as &quot; inducing the degrading of sake brewing technology . &quot;
because of this easing of regulations , there is a lingering doubt that many brands which could not be named junmaishu because of using rice powder , etc. although no alcohol was added , were upgraded to junmaishu .
in reality , however , as there are restrictions &quot; koji ratio 15 % or more &quot; and &quot; use of standard rice , &quot; sake with the ratio of koji below fifteen percent , produced from substandard rice , crushed rice produced in the process of polishing rice , or rice powder cannot be called &quot; junmaishu . &quot;
on the other hand , new types of junmaishu have been developed , such as low polishing ratio sake for which sakamai with low polishing ratio not used even for futsushu , is used as raw material in order to create unique sake quality , while fulfilling the above-mentioned conditions .
they are a seishu which is produced with rice with a polishing ratio of sixty percent or lower , malted rice and water and produced with special care and it has a unique flavor and the color is favorable .
they are produced by fermenting at low temperature spending a long time .
they are characterized by a gorgeous fragrance called ginjoko that makes a person remember apples or bananas .
at the end , in order to draw out the ginjoko , distilled alcohol is added in an amount not exceeding 120 liters per ton of polished rice ( the weight ratio of alcohol to rice is 1 : 10 ) .
among ginjoshu , those to which no distilled alcohol is added , is called especially , junmai ginjoshu .
generally speaking , it has a gentler fragrance ( reserved fragrance ) compared to other ginjoshu .
including this article , the expression &quot; ginjo system ( sake ) &quot; means a group of sake having ginjoko such as ginjoshu , junmai ginjoshu , daiginjoshu , junmai daiginjoshu , and yamahai ginjoshu ( ginjoshu produced with yamahai method ) .
development was commenced in 1920 &apos;s and , promoted by the improvement of rice polishing techniques in the 1930 &apos;s and development of temperature control techniques in 1970 &apos;s , the production volume which is sufficient to distribute in the general market could be secured .
distribution of ginjoshu in the domestic market of Japan has been conducted since the 1980 &apos;s and , after 2000 , the demand has increased even outside Japan . ( refer to &quot; Birth of Ginjo Sake . )
daiginjoshu is a seishu which is produced with rice with a polishing ratio of fifty percent or lower , malted rice and water and produced with special care and for which fermentation is carried out at a lower temperature spending a longer time compared to ginjoshu .
unique flavor and color must be especially favorable .
at the end , in order to draw out ginjoko , a small amount of distilled alcohol is added in some cases .
they are characterized by fruity and gorgeous fragrance and a light and smooth taste .
among daiginjoshu , those for which only polished rice , malted rice , and water are used as raw materials are called junmai daiginjoshu .
generally speaking , it has a gentler fragrance and deeper flavor compared to other daiginjoshu .
we can say that daiginjoshu is the top product among sake brewed by polishing sakamai of the best quality to the ultimate level and combining capabilities of the workers in the sake brewery .
( refer to &quot; Birth of Ginjoshu . )
arbitrary items to be denoted , provided for in the Standards for Manufacturing Methods and Quality Indication for Sake for the National Tax Agency , are as follows :
variety name of raw material rice
if raw material rice of a specific variety , such as shuzo kotekimai is used for 50 % or more , the variety name and the ratio of usage may be denoted .
place of sake production
if sake is produced in a single production facility , the facility may be denoted .
number of years stored
if sake is stored and matured for one year or longer , the number of years of storage may be denoted .
certain sake breweries sell sake , which has been stored for one year or longer , under names such as koshu ( old sake ) , kokoshu ( old old sake ) , daikoshu ( very old sake ) , jukuseishu ( matured sake ) and hizoshu ( treasured sake ) .
there is no uniform standard for the number of years and terms .
unprocessed sake
seishu for which no warimizu or kasuichosei ( excluding kasuichosei by which alcohol concentration is not changed one percent or more ) has been conducted after joso
raw sake
seishu for which no heating or pasteurization has been conducted
as raw sake is perishable the same as cow milk and vulnerable to degradation , appropriate care must be used for freshness and it must be refrigerated . ( refer to &quot; Problems of &apos; Raw sake . &quot; )
raw stored sake
seishu stored without pasteurization after production and pasteurized just before carrying out from the production site
the period of storage is not provided for . ( refer to &quot; Problems of &apos; Raw Sake . &quot; )
Kiippon
junmaishu brewed in a single brewery
Taruzake ( literally , cask sake )
seishu stored in a wooden cask and having a lingering fragrance ( including those rebottled to bottle or other container ) .
Namazumezake ( raw bottled sake )
opposite to raw stored sake , seishu which , after production , has been pasteurized and stored and for which no pasteurization is conducted before shipping from the production site . ( refer to &quot; Problems of &apos; Raw Sake . &quot; )
hiyaoroshi
seishu which , after brewing in wintertime , has matured in a cool brewery during spring and summer and bottled and shipped in autumn when the air temperature becomes low
refer to &quot; Hiyaoroshi &quot; on this page .
the following three items are classification according to timing ( preceding stage , medium stage and late stage ) during squeezing at the time of joso , but there is no clear standard .
arabashiri
sake gushing out at the beginning of joso , in other words , when moromi is squeezed using a squeezer called fune
arabashiri comes out automatically with the weight of sakabukuro ( bag for squeezing ) stacked at first without applying any additional pressure .
generally speaking , arabashiri contains much solid content , ori ( lees ) , and the alcohol concentration is rather low , it is very fragrant and has a crisp taste .
nakadori , nakagumi or nakadare
a portion which comes out as the medium layer after arabashiri during joso process
alcohol concentration and taste are medium .
it has the best balance between taste and fragrance and some say that it has a more refined taste than arabashiri .
strictly speaking , at the stage of nakadori , nakagumi or nakadare , there are two stages ; the first one is sake squeezed by the weight of stacked sakabukuro when sakabukuro is stacked to completely fill the fune and the second one is sake that comes out when additional weight is applied in addition to the weight of the sakabukuro .
seme , or oshikiri
the portion that comes out last during joso .
in particular , in the case of funeshibori , the portion that comes out when squeezed
it has a rather high alcohol concentration and a thick taste .
fukurozuri ( literally , bag hanging ) , fukuroshibori ( bag squeezing ) , sizukushibori ( drip squeezing ) , or kubitsuri , ( hanging )
it is a method of taking sake which , at the time of joso , bags are filled with moromi and hung and sake drippings are collected .
this method is often used for high-class sake such as sake to be sent to exhibitions .
sometimes , sake which is obtained by such method is called shizukuzake ( literally , drop sake ) .
Tobintori or tobinkakoi
this is a method of selecting sake , at the time of joso , when the sake is divided by filling the tobin ( bottle with a capacity of eighteen liters ) and good sake is selected from the bottles .
this method is often used for high-class sake such as sake to be sent to exhibitions .
Muroka ( non-filtered )
it is sake for which no flavor adjustment by filtration with active charcoal is conducted .
nigorizake or origarami
nigorizake ( literally , cloudy sake ) is sake which , at the time of joso , is filtered with rough-textured cloth , etc to intentionally allow the lees to remain .
if no pasteurization takes place , fermentation continues in the bottle and sake changes into a sparkling one .
origarami is sake for which no orisage is conducted .
both are produced to enjoy umami contained in ori and the strong fragrance or flavor which are unique to moromi .
geographical indication
it may be labeled in an area which is designated by the Commissioner of the National Tax Administration Agency under the &quot; Establishing Standards for Labeling of Geographical Indications &quot; by the National Tax Administration Agency .
raw materials , manufacturing method , etc. are restricted so that features of the area are fully used .
if such designation is obtained , as similar indications ( &quot; prepared by XXX method , &quot; &quot; seishu in XXX style &quot; ) for seishu produced in other areas are prohibited , local brands can be protected .
although it is expected to be utilized widely because of such reasons , only Hakusan ( Hakusan Kikusake , Hakusan City , Ishikawa Prefecture , designated in December 2005 ) has obtained the designation as sake as of March 2008 .
in recent years , seishu produced in foreign countries has entered circulation and general consumers often see such sake .
when we consider sake as an alcoholic drink , as it requires high-level fermenting technology compared to other alcoholic drinks such as whisky and wine , it is a type of alcoholic drink that requires a lot of effort and labor to complete as a product .
in procuring sakamai as raw material , sake can be brewed with very favorable conditions in areas ( countries ) with favorable geographical conditions that allow large-scale cultivation using large machines .
some large sake brewing companies have been brewing sake in foreign countries .
completed products are not only sold in their local market , but also imported into Japan .
when such sake is sold in Japan , it is necessary to label the country of origin and use of sake produced in foreign country .
under Article 11-5 of the Ministerial Ordinance No. 11 of the Ministry of Finance dated March 6 , 1953 , it is allowed to label seishu as Japanese sake , they are labeled as &quot; seishu manufactured in foreign country &quot; or &quot; Japanese sake manufactured in foreign country . &quot;
the &quot; Establishing Standards for Labeling of Geographical Indications &quot; was amended and enforced October 1 , 2005 .
with this amendment , a new provision for the protection of geographical indications , &quot; Among places of manufacturing seishu , the geographical indication for the place designated by the Commissioner of the National Tax Administration Agency may not be used for seishu that is produced in an area other than the designated one . &quot; was newly established .
before this amendment , the National Tax Administration Agency advertised for public opinions .
submitted opinions are opened to the general public in Public Comment of the National Tax Administration Agency .
1 sho = 10 go = 1.8 liters
1 koku = 10 to = 100 sho ( approx . 180 liters )
all of those units for volume belong to Shakkanho , the Japanese unit system .
1 sho is a volume that can be put into obin ( literally , large bottle ) for sake , namely isshobin ( literally , one-sho bottle ) which is usually seen in liquor shops .
since &quot; Hakutsuru &quot; commenced to sell sake with ishobin in 1901 , it was the mainstream for over one hundred years .
in recent years , some say that the size and associated image of unrefinedness are causes of decrease in consumption and there is a tendency to switch to smaller bottles . ( refer to &quot; Nihonshu no Genzai &quot; - Current situation of sake )
so-called chubin ( middle-size bottle ) is yongobin which can literally contain 4 go ( 720 milliliters ) .
breweries use tobin which can contain 18 liters and the labeling words &quot; tobin kakoi , &quot; which we see in liquor shops , came from this fact . ( refer to other indications )
the unit &quot; koku &quot; is mainly used to show the production volume of the brewery .
as this also is a very rough guide , a small brewery in general produces 500 koku annually and a large brewery more than 5,000 koku .
of course , there is no correlative relationship between the number of koku for produced sake and the quality of produced sake .
1 ka = two sake casks = 70 sho of sake ( approx . ) = 126 liters
&quot; ka &quot; is a unit mainly used for overland transportation of sake .
casks became a mean to transport sake since the Azuchimomoyama period .
it can be traced back to the fact a carrier shouldered a carrying pole with sake casks , one each for the front and rear .
casks are yontodaru ( 4 to cask ) , but , usually , a cask is filled with approximately 3.5 to of sake instead of full , namely 4.to .
therefore , it was calculated as 70 sho .
as seen from nihonshudo , there is a certain width of the range of specific gravity of sake .
if we assume that the specific gravity of sake is the same as water , carrier walks on the road with approximately 126 kg load on his shoulder .
1 hai ( or ippai ; literally , one cup )
today , even if we say &quot; Let &apos;s have ippai . , &quot; it does not necessarily mean to have &quot; one drinking cup or glass &quot; of sake .
going back to the Edo period or before , &quot; ippai &quot; was a unit for volume .
it was not a strictly uniform unit and there were certain differences depending on the district or feudal domain .
when Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI carried out taiko kenchi ( the cadastral surveys conducted by Hideyoshi ) , he also established standards for weights and measures and established &quot; kyomasu &quot; for volume .
even during the Edo period , however , it was not popularly used in feudal domains in the Tohoku District .
regardless of minor differences , as it is said that , in general , &quot; 100 hai ( or pai ) was equal to ( approximately ) 4 to . &quot;
therefore , &quot; 1 hai is ( approximately ) 720 milliliters , which is a volume similar to a 4 go bottle or a wine bottle .
at that time , to drink &quot; 1 hai &quot; of sake meant to dry up a 4 go bottle .
Kon
today , kon is used to mean &quot; to drink sake together &quot; as we say &quot; Let &apos;s have 1 kon . &quot;
in ancient times , &quot; 1 kon &quot; meant to fill a sake cup full with sake and the sake cup was passed around to all members of the drinking party .
for example , we can find an expression like &quot; after three kon of the drinking party . &quot;
it is a unit that represents sake &apos;s specific gravity .
it is measured by adjusting sake &apos;s temperature to fifteen degrees centigrade using a specified aerometer that floats in sake .
nihonshudo zero is defined as sake that has same weight as that of distilled water of four degrees centigrade .
lighter sake has a value in plus and heavier sake a value in minus .
nihonshudo is defined in the Measuring Act as follows :
nihonshudo = ( ( 1 / specific gravity ) - 1 ) x 1.443
by back calculating this formula , the following formula is obtained .
sake &apos;s specific gravity at fifteen degrees centigrade = 1.443 / ( 1.443 + Nihonshudo )
in recent years , especially since the dry sake boom , there is the tendency to deem nihonshudo as the decisive standard to determine the dryness of sake , but this is not correct .
certainly , nihonshudo is a convenient guide for estimating , but , to be precise , it is shown more exactly by amakarado ( literally , degree of sweetness / dryness ) .
however , even amakarado cannot quantify all human sense of taste .
&quot; Sensing sweetness and dryness &quot; which an ordinary person can sense with his tongue fluctuates depending upon fragrance , umami , koku ( body ) and food and seasoning that is eaten together with sake as well as the physical condition of the person .
acid level is defined as the number of milliliters of 1 / 10 normal solution of sodium hydrate for titration that is required for disacidifying ten milliliters of sake .
if this value is large , such expression as &quot; sappari ( flinty ) &quot; is used and if small , such expression as &quot; kokugaaru ( having plenty of body ) &quot; is used .
however , same as in the case of nihonshudo , the sense of taste of an ordinary person fluctuates greatly depending on fragrance , combination of food and drink and physical condition .
amakarado is a value that represents the degree of sweetness / dryness of sake .
it is calculated from the concentration of glucose sugar and acid level as follows :
amakarado = 0.86 x glucose concentration - 1.16 x acid level - 1.31
it is also calculated using nihonshudo instead of glucose concentration as - 1.16 x acid level - 132.57 .
this formula explains eighty-one percent of human sense to sense the sweetness / dryness of sake .
the relationship between the degree of sweetness / dryness and the number of amakarado is as shown in the table below .
notando is a value that represents the degree of depth of flavor of sake .
it is calculated with the glucose concentration and acid level of sake as follows :
notando = 0.42 x glucose concentration - 1.88 x acid level -4.44
glucose concentration represents the amount of sugar after excluding dexistrin , which is a direct reducing sugar and has a large molecular structure .
the larger the notando on the plus side is , the deeper the flavor of sake .
amakarado and notando are seldom labeled , but as indexes of taste , they are more reliable than nihondhudo .
same as in the case of acid level , amino acid level is defined as the number of milliliters of 1 / 10 normal solution of sodium hydrate that is required for disacidifying 10 milliliters of sake after disacidifying 10 milliliters of sake with 1 / 10 normal sodium hydrate and adding 5 milliliter of neutral formalin ( measurement by formol titration ) .
the value is equal to the number obtained by the sodium hydrate titration of the latter .
generally speaking , if the value is large the flavor of sake is deep and if it is small , the flavor is tanrei ( crispy and dry ) .
however , same as in the case of nihonshudo , sense of taste of an ordinary person fluctuates greatly depending on fragrance , combination of food and drink and physical condition .
amino acids contained in sake consist of various types of minor constituents , which are derived from protein contained in raw material , rice , and decomposed , such as glutamic acid , proline , alanine , valine and leucine .
depending upon the composition of such constituents , a large variety of umami are created .
the reason why it is often said that , even if the taste of sake is quantified with various indexes such as nihonshudo and amakarado , we cannot tell the taste of sake with figures in this large variety in the composition of amino acids .
in completely fermented junmaishu , nucleic acids such as histamine are generated , though in very small quantity , which sake yeast generates by being placed in an extreme condition at the end of the process of producing moromi .
basically , the higher the amino acid level is , the deeper the taste with umami is .
if it is too high , however , the taste becomes dull .
generally speaking , kimoto and yamahaimoto have a tendency to have a lot of amino acids .
it is also said that it is the way of brewing of capable toji to keep amino acids content low even with kimoto or yamahaimoto .
it is also true , however , that there are many sake drinkers who like taste of kimoto or yamahaimoto containing a lot of amino acids .
the main cause of amino acid generation is acid protease that is a protein-cutting enzyme and almost all amino acids are generated between nakashigoto and shimaishigoto in the koji producing process in the temperature range of thirty-four to thirty-eight degrees centigrade .
therefore , any toji who wants to make the final taste of sake light progresses the koji production process keeping rice for koji from becoming dry and completes this process as quickly as possible .
in contrast , if he wants to make sake taste heavy , he uses a longer time for this process .
karakuchi ( dry )
evaluation of sake taste is basically made on five flavors ; san ( sour ) , ku ( bitter ) , kan ( sweet ) , shin ( hot or dry ) , and kan ( salty ) , concept is quite different from those for cooking even if the same words are used .
even if we say &quot; karai ( shin ) , &quot; it does not mean &quot; hot &quot; in cooking ( taste of red pepper or pepper ) or kan ( saltiness ) .
sense of taste which is sensed by taste buds on the surface of the tongue and sent to the brain can feel only sweetness , sourness , saltiness , bitterness and umami .
because taste cells do not have any accepter of &quot; karami ( dryness ) , &quot; it is considered that to sense &quot; sake is dry , &quot; pain sensation on the surface of tongue is stimulated by alcohol .
therefore , generally speaking , sake is felt to be dry if its alcohol content and nihonshudo are high .
during the Showa period , three-time increased sake volume was produced by adding alcohol randomly .
it was not a &quot; dryness of good quality . &quot;
true dry sake cannot be produced only with alcohol content .
once understanding that &quot; tanrei karakuchi ( tanrei and dry ) is the basic condition for excellent sake that &quot; prevailed ( Refer to &quot; Karakuchi boom &quot; ) , but it is not a correct understanding .
it adds up to ; &quot; karakuchi has karakuchi &apos;s feature and umakuchi has umakuchi &apos;s feature . &quot;
as sense of taste fluctuates depending on physical conditions , the comment &quot; This sake is sweet / dry . &quot; does not have important meaning . ( refer to nihonshudo , amakarado and amino acid level . ) .
experienced sake drinkers scarcely evaluate sake with &quot; amakuchi ( literally , sweet sake ) / karakuchi . &quot;
amakuchi
as it is often confused with umakuchi , sufficient care should be used .
it is not correct to consider too quickly &quot; If nihonshudo is low , the sake is amackuchi . &quot;
if the specific gravity of sake is large as in sake with a large lees content , such as nigorizake and origarami , such sake has very low nihonshudo , and it sometimes goes far below zero like &quot; minus 15 . &quot;
the fact that there are many &quot; dry nigorizake &quot; among such sake with low nihonshudo is an example which shows that the specific gravity or nihonshudo does not have a close connection with &quot; sweetness &quot; and &quot; dryness . &quot;
amazake ( a sweet low-alcohol drink made from fermented rice or sake lees ) , dessert sake especially for female consumers and sake products made from morohaku ( sake of 100 % polished white rice ) , etc. are examples of amakuchi .
umakuchi
with respect to seishu , what is expressed as &quot; amakuchi &quot; is usually in most cases umakuchi .
umakuchi can be easily mistaken for &quot; amakuchi &quot; because , relatively speaking , the human organ that senses karami ( dryness ) is not really stimulated when something that is umakuchi is drunk .
umakuchi is a sweet-smelling flavor having rather koku ( body ) and okuyuki ( literally , depth ) than kire which often constitutes a factor of karakuchi .
in order to obtain a targeted final product , it is said that umakuchi is more difficult to create for a brewer as it cannot be falsified with high alcohol content .
tanrei ( crispy and dry )
the expression is used when sake gives clear and smooth feeling when put into the mouth
originally , &quot; 端麗 &quot; is correct as a Japanese word .
during the karakuchi boom started in 1980 &apos;s , they started to write it as &quot; 淡麗 &quot; through trademark , etc .
as sakamai &quot; 越淡麗 ( koshitanrei ) &quot; was developed in Niigata Prefecture , which is representative sake for sale with such taste as a recommendable variety , it has become popular to write as &quot; 淡麗 &quot; as far as sake taste is concerned .
hojun
it means strong fragrance and good taste .
in this case also , originally , &quot; 芳醇 &quot; is correct ( in certain dictionaries for Japanese language , it is written as &quot; 芳純 &quot; or &quot; 芳潤 &quot; instead of &quot; 芳醇 &quot; ) .
as it has become popular through trademarks , names of sake , etc. it is also written as &quot; 豊醇 . &quot;
Nojun
it means strong taste .
Nojun is in the opposite end of &quot; tanrei . &quot;
pin
it represents a firm crispy aftertaste .
it constitutes the balance of tastes kara ( dry ) , ama ( sweet ) and uma ( umami ) .
we can say that this balance defines the outline of sake taste .
Kire
if aftertaste is refreshing and light , it is expressed as &quot; Kire ga aru ( It has sharpness ) . &quot;
in certain districts , it is expressed as &quot; Sabake ga yoi . &quot;
ARAI ( literally , harsh )
it means to feel a stimulus when put into the mouth .
it is an uplifting and youthful taste , if spoken with good intention , but , if spoken ill , a taste that lacks feeling of maturity .
Ginaji
it denotes plain umami obtained with sake that has been matured at low temperature spending a long time .
fukurami
it denotes a well-balanced taste with body that spreads in the mouth .
it is also expressed as &quot; gokumi &quot; or &quot; aji no haba ( literally , width of taste . &quot;
gokumi
the condition in which five tastes are well-harmonized and give a feeling of well-balanced koku ( body ) is expressed as &quot; It has gokumi . &quot;
shurenmi
it means a bitter taste that is sensed when sake is still young and causes a person to make his mouth narrower .
in most cases , it disappears in line with the maturity of sake .
contrarily , the degree of maturity of sake by tongue checking to see if shurenmi has disappeared or not .
oshiaji
it means a taste that , after tasting sake , gives an aftertaste that makes a person feel full and have a stable afterglow .
Koshi
if there is oshiaji and a stable flavor remaining , it is expressed as &quot; koshi ga aru ( Literally , &quot; It has koshi &quot; ) or &quot; koshi ga tsuyoi ( Literally , &quot; Koshi is strong &quot; ) .
contrarily , if the aftertaste is unclear one , it is expressed as &quot; koshi ga nai ( Literally , &quot; It has no koshi &quot; ) or &quot; koshi ga yowai ( Literally , &quot; Koshi is weak &quot; ) .
Dossiri
this expression is used for an elaborately created taste that gives fukurami ( fullness ) and koshi and is not disturbed by warming sake .
shikkari
this expression is used for an elaborately created taste that gives the feeling of stability and koshi and is not disturbed by warming sake .
in a certain sense , &quot; shikkari &quot; is used more often than &quot; dosshiri , &quot; it is true that it is difficult for beginners to judge whether or not the taste is shikkari .
an easy method for beginners to judge is to taste sake after diluting sake to alcohol content of 14 % and at drinking temperature .
if sake gives a good ajikire , the sake is of &quot; shikkari &quot; brewing .
if sake contains too many undegraded ingredients or the yeasts has died abruptly at the last stage of sake mash , the yeasts gives off unfavorable amino acids making ajikire bad .
generally speaking , such sake tends to be degraded quickly compared with sake after complete fermentation and its taste is not expressed as &quot; shikkari . &quot;
such matters can be best judged by the subjective view of the individual , namely sense of taste .
it cannot be judged by the amino acid level shown on the backside label .
( taste / fragrance ) opens
if sake is taken unwarmed , in certain cases , the original taste , fragrance , etc. of sake are confined in the coldness and cannot be sensed .
but , if such sake is warmed to so-called hitohadakan ( literally , temperature of human skin ) or drinking temperature , such taste , fragrance , etc. the taste awakens like flower petals opening slowly .
this expression is used for such occasion .
if sake is heated too much , however , it become tasteless .
for your information , Nihon Sakasho Kenkyukai has the opinion that the classification of taste using &quot; amai / karai &quot; and &quot; tanrei / hojun &quot; as coordinate axes has no practical meaning and uses the following four-category method using &quot; strong / weak fragrance &quot; and &quot; much / little taste &quot; as new coordinate axes .
Jukushu ( literally , matured sake )
sake with strong fragrance and much flavor
flavor of full-bodied matured sake spending a long time
jukuseishu , koshu , hizoshu , etc .
Junshu
sake with weak fragrance and strong flavor
flavor that make a person feel so-called koku
junmaishu , kimotokei , etc .
Kunshu
sake with strong fragrance and a little flavor
sake that allows one to enjoy ginjoko
daiginjoshu , etc .
Soshu
sake with weak fragrance and a little flavor
it is light and smooth .
namazake , namachozoshu , low-alcohol sake , etc .
fresh sake coming out from the funakuchi at the brewery has an original color very close to the golden color seen in the ears of rice plants during the autumn .
as maturing progresses , the color changes to dark brown or some gets a slight greenish tint .
daiginjoshu with a high rice-polishing ratio that has been elaborately produced has a luster clearly shining like a diamond .
such color of sake is appreciated by those who are fond of drinking sake .
with respect to the Zenkoku Shinshu Kanpyokai , in the past , there was a period in which sake submitted by leaving color of sake as it was , was subjected to deduction of points and , therefore , breweries tried their best to eliminate the color of sake using active charcoal , etc .
as a result , sake became clear and colorless like water as generally imagined form the word &quot; seishu . &quot;
as the number of breweries that distribute sake with its natural color has been increasing , it has become possible to enjoy sake color .
Sae
beautiful and clear luster
the condition in which bluish tint is observed is called aozae and is appreciated very highly .
teri
condition in which bright yellow luster is observed
it is popular in most cases .
boke
this means that sake is a little clouded and the colors are unclear .
transparency
index that shows how transparent produced sake is
Clearness
naturally made clear and twinkling fresh
golden yellow
color tone which is the most liked among various teri ( luster )
Banshairo ( color of coarse tea )
a little dark and matured color tone which is often seen in koshu
compared to golden yellow , this color is less often an object of appreciation .
colored well
standard expression used in Kanpyokai , etc. to mean that color tone is favorable
colored deeply
condition in which sake is rather deeply colored
many accept it as favorable .
Cloudiness
it means cloudy with various color tones .
although not highly appreciated for its appearance , such sake is not necessarily bad tasting in general .
same as in the case of words and expressions for manufacturing methods , they differ depending on the period , generation , and district , but the standard words follow :
jukuseiko
favorable fragrance generated by maturing and a strong one is also called &quot; koshuko ( flavor of koshu ) . &quot;
natures of fragrances are different and they are expressed by comparison to Shaoxing rice wine , sherry , caramel , dried shiitake mushroom , raison , etc .
ginjoko ( or ginjoka )
it is often said that &quot; ginjoko &quot; is the correct pronunciation .
we must be careful because even some specialists indicate reading it as &quot; ginjoka &quot; purposely to ask the special care of readers .
fragrance specific to ginjoshu , and junmai ginjoshu as well as daiginjoshu and junmai daiginjoshu
fragrances of apple and banana are most popular , but some sake produce ginjoko like marron , cream or chocolate .
ginjoko is not generated by adding perfumes .
it is a fragrance derived from esters , especially ethyl caproate and isoamyl acetate , generated by sake yeast in the process of low-temperature fermentation like ginjo brewing . ( refer to &quot; Moromi . &quot; )
it is often felt from other sake which elaborately produced junmaishu rather than ginjoshu .
not all of the generated ginjoko remain in moromi , a large portion is diffused into the air .
in the past , such flavor was recollected and liquefied by Yakoman equipment and returned into moromi and , sometimes , added to other sake than moromi from which such flavor is recollected .
it is said that such a process has became unnecessary thanks to development of new types of sake yeasts .
apple-like fragrance
a type of ginjoko that is similar to fragrance of Delicious apple due to ethyl capronate
they say that moderate apple-like fragrance gives ginjoshu elegance .
banana-like fragrance
a type of ginjoko that is similar to banana fragrance due to isoamyl acetate
moderate banana-like fragrance is popular as it adds a sweet and fruity fragrance to sake .
however , if a banana-like fragrance is too strong , it is felt to be an unusual smell and called the &quot; smell of ethyl acetate &quot; or &quot; smell of Cemedine &quot; and it becomes the cause of point deduction .
it is also a main fragrance which is recollected with Yakoman equipment .
shinshubana ( literally , flower of fresh sake )
young fragrance unique to fresh sake derived from koji and it disappears as maturing progresses .
experienced drinkers who like warmed sake usually do not like shinshubana which is strengthened by the process of warming sake .
smell of alcohol
it is a drug-like smell generated by incorrectly adding alcohol .
different from alcohol produced by fermentation , added alcohol which has not been integrated with sake becomes detached causing such smell .
hineka
unfavorable smell which is generated when sake becomes oxidized due to reasons such as &quot; Maturing progressed too much ( over maturing ) , &quot; &quot; degraded before maturity &quot; and &quot; improper storing method . &quot;
quite close to jukuseiko ( fragrance of matured sake ) ; it is classified into hineka if it is unpleasant
therefore , in very rare case , a slight hineka is positively appreciated as adding some value to sake .
namahineka
powerful stuffy malodor generated by action of enzyme due to &quot; namazake aging &quot; or &quot; storing method was not proper . &quot;
it cannot be removed even by filtration and if it occurs before shipment , it is serious trouble for the brewery .
in reality , however , it is usually caused by improper storing method or temperature control by a distributor , or retailer after shipment or consumer after purchase .
we will make no errors if we consider that &quot; namazake is milk from rice . &quot;
tsuwariko ( literally , the smell of morning sickness )
it is a malodor like sour milk products caused by failure in fermentation of moromi and it is called tsuwariko because it makes a person feel like vomiting .
specialists call it &quot; smell of diacetyl &quot; and is similar to &quot; Hiochishu . &quot;
Hiochishu
it is a smell caused by the breeding of hiochi bacteria and , although manner differs depending upon the type of bacteria , it is similar to tsuwarishu .
Rokashu ( smell by filtration )
collective term for unusual odor added in the process of filtering
they say that it is similar to a smell which is felt when Japanese paper is made wet with water .
Sumishu ( smell of charcoal )
this is unusual odor added if low quality charcoal is used in the process of filtration or too much charcoal is used .
as charcoal itself tends to absorb odors , it is often caused by odor absorbed by charcoal during storage and discharged into sake when charcoal is put into sake .
Sanpaishu ( oxidative rancidity )
highly unpleasant odor caused by contamination of moronic with fuzokin , a type of unfavorable bacterium and resulting generated acetic acid , etc .
Fukuroshu ( smell of bags )
smell of sakabukuro ( literally , bag for sake ) used for squeezing moromi lingered into sake
it happens if sakabukuro is not controlled properly and there is oxidized adhered material .
nikkoshu ( smell of sunshine )
unusual acrid odor generated through exposure to sunshine
it is also called &quot; hinatashu ( smell of a sunny place ) &quot; or &quot; kemonoshu ( smell of a wild animal ) . &quot;
it also occurs through exposure for a long time period to a light beam other than sunshine such as fluorescent lamp for indoor use .
it is usually caused by improper storing method by distributor , or retailer after shipment or consumer after purchase .
it can be prevented by wrapping the bottle with newspaper , etc .
in the past , it was thought to be the smell of the bottle containing the sake and , therefore , the word &quot; binshu ( smell of bottle ) &quot; was used .
at present , it is said this smell is the mixture of nikkoshu and hineko .
kika ( or , kiga , mokuga , mokuka or mokka ) ( literally , smell of wood )
it is often said that &quot; kika &quot; is the correct pronunciation .
we must be careful because even some specialists indicate reading as &quot; kiga &quot; purposely to ask special care of readers .
it is a fragrance of wood used for a cask such as Japanese cedar that contains the sake .
although it is appreciated positively depending on the degree of fragrance and sake quality , the fact that &quot; sake has kigashu &quot; is often a cause of point deduction in kanpyokai , etc .
a smell similar to kika which may be generated if alcohol is added in the process of fermentation , it is called &quot; kikayoshu ( kika-like smell ) . &quot;
although , it is completely different , it is often confused with something else .
fragrances that are felt in each step from taking the sake cup in hand until sake is swallowed are called respectively as follows :
uwadachika
fragrance that is sensed before putting sake into the mouth coming from the surface of sake to the nose
it is volatile bouquet that comes out when sake is poured into a choko ( sake cup ) and choko is moved around .
with respect to sake for which ginjoko is focused on or sake displayed in Zenkoku Shinshu Kanpyokai , an importance is attached to this fragrance .
Fukumika
fragrance that goes through to the nose when sake is taken into mouth and tasted on the tongue
as the component for this fragrance is less volatile than that for uwadachika , the fragrance cannot be sensed until sake is put into the mouth .
ginka
fragrance that is sensed when sake is swallowed and passes through the throat
in sake tasting on the occasion of kanpyokai , sake is not swallowed and forced out after tasting , ginka cannot be tasted .
therefore , the problem is that ginka cannot be the object of appreciation in kanpyokai .
at present , ginka represents almost the same smell as &quot; ginjoko . &quot;
kaerika
fragrance that , after drinking sake , comes up from stomach to the nose
there are many knowledgeable persons who are of opinion that kaerika is excluded from the objects of appreciation in kanpyokai , etc .
also , they are not unified terms , but the standard ones are as follows :
however , at the beginning of 2000 &apos;s , the term &quot; hiya ( literally , cold sake ) &quot; is sometimes overinterpreted to mean sake that is cooled down below normal temperature .
generally speaking , a sour taste sensed by the tongue decreases as the rise of sake temperature , and umami increases .
therefore , roughly speaking in the range between &quot; hiya &quot; and &quot; atsukan , &quot; the higher the sake temperature is , the more the taste has body and depth and also karasa ( dryness ) is felt .
with sake produced with traditional methods such as kimotokei and junmaishu , in many cases , sake that is not so impressive when taken cold shows itself at its best .
such sake is expressed as sake that does &quot; kanbae . &quot;
to do &quot; kanagari &quot; means that , when sake is warmed , the warmness goes through evenly and the complete sake making features are shown at its best .
the most sure method to let sake do &quot; kanagari &quot; is to put sake into a tokuri ( sake bottle ) and warm it with hot water .
it is also effective to certain extent to put sake into a choko and warm with a kitchen microwave , but it tends to cause uneven heat distribution in the sake .
if sake warmed once gets cold again , it is expressed that sake becomes &quot; kanzamashi . &quot;
elaborately produced sake has a certain flavor even if it becomes kanzamashi .
with respect to other sake , the balance of flavors is spoiled and a smell of alcohol like a drug comes out as uwadachika .
this is called &quot; kankuzure . &quot;
therefore , depending on the quality of each sake , the best drinking temperature differs .
in recent years , the temperature range recommended by the brewer is shown on the sub-label ( label on the backside ) .
among experienced drinkers , however , many drink sake even in the summer with nurukan ( approximately same as body temperature ) or atsukan telling &quot; If cooled down , any sake can be thought delicious cheated by the coldness , but , if the temperature is the same as that of the tongue , only really good sake can taste good . &quot;
because alcohol is not absorbed from stomach or the bowel walls unless its temperature becomes same as the body temperature .
therefore , if taken at the temperature range below hiya , the drinker feels it is smooth in the mouth and does not get drunk easily and feels like he can drink without any limits .
then , he becomes drunk unexpectedly suddenly and the time of so-called &quot; horoyoi ( being slightly drunk ) &quot; whereby a delicate flavor could be tasted cannot be experienced for long time .
in other words , the time in which the taste of sake can be enjoyed in real time is short .
this is also a reason why the person who places a priority on &quot; flavor &quot; rather than on &quot; drunkenness &quot; prefers a warm temperature zone .
in the case of sake quality which is characterized by freshness , such as namazake , as it cannot stand kan ( warming ) , it tastes better to drink ryobie or below .
however , as of 2008 , in many shops , even if the customer orders warmed sake , the shop will not accept the order and serves cooled sake instead .
it is not too much to say that it is a vestige of temporary decline of the culture of sake at the beginning of the Heisei period .
( refer to &quot; Slumped Period of Sake Consumption . &quot; )
some shops recommend to take sake hiya or below so that unskilled warming is not revealed , because warming sake requires a delicate skill and others do so just to prevent trouble because to serve warmed sake requires more time than hiya .
anyway , if a shop declines to serve sake warm by reason of sake quality saying &quot; The sake is not good warm . &quot; it is desirable that consumers have knowledge to judge whether or not it is true .
it is because , as represented by Shinkame , Saitama Prefecture , that there are many breweries that produce sake so the flavor of sake can be enjoyed best if taken warm .
among prefectural sake brewers associations , there are certain associations that are not favorable to breweries that produce traditionally sake to be taken warm saying on the occasion of autonomous kanpyokai , kikizakekai ( sake tasting party ) , fairs and fiesta telling &quot; Any brewery that wishes to serve its sake warm , warmed sake should be brought with brewer &apos;s own pot because the organizer does not provide any tool or materials for warming sake . &quot;
general consumers can see with their own eyes when they visit various sake events where sake brewers associations have such a tendency .
sake , together with Shaoxing rice wine of China , is unique in the way of drinking to take it warm is popular .
people in Edo showed off saying &quot; Sake should be taken warm , sakana ( dishes eaten with sake ) should be kidori ( dishes without peculiar flavor ) , and shaku ( a person who serves sake ) should be done by tabo ( geisha with traditional Japanese hair style ) . &quot;
as kan has a close relation with a seasonal temperature , it gave birth to regular annual events such as bekka ( using separate fire for cooking ) .
utensils used for drinking sake that support life in Japan carefully in detail
sakazuki ( sake cup )
as we see in expressions like &quot; exchanging sakazuki &quot; and &quot; to give sakazuki , &quot; in Japanese culture , sakazuki is not only a vessel used for drinking sake , but also a complicated medium that has a connection with various cultural factors such as human relations , honor , and formalities .
today , we bring up the image of &quot; nurisakazuki ( lacquerware sakazuki ) , &quot; but ceramic sakazuki were also used in the latter part of the Edo period .
tokkuri ( or tokuri )
even today , tokkuri is used for pouring sake .
until it became popular to sell sake by bottles in the modern age , sake traders usually sold sake by measure using tokkuri .
usually , tokkuri used for selling sake was not owned by individuals but it was lent by sake trader and yago ( the name of the store ) was written with large-sized characters .
during and before the Edo period , the color of used tokkuri was different in Kamigata ( Kansai District ) and Edo .
in Kamigata , brown earthenware tokkuri that can contained five go ( 900 milliliters ) or one sho ( 1.8 liters ) was used .
in Edo , gray earthenware or kegs with a handle was used .
choko ( or choku )
currently , choko is a small vessel used for receiving sake from a tokkuri to drink it .
however , there is not a long history in using choko in combination with tokkuri .
during the Edo period , both in Kamigata and Edo , sake was received with sakazuki at the beginning of the party and , in the latter half of the party where the mood changed to a relaxed one , choko was used instead .
choshi ( sake decanter )
this is a container used to pour warmed sake used even today .
as one goes forward in time , the size of choshi has been becoming smaller .
during the Edo period , choshi was used to warm sake in Kamigata in a palace and a house of prostitution , but , in Edo , choshi was used only for shikijo which was a formal meal .
at the present day , choshi and tokkuri ware treated as almost same things , but , in the Edo period , they were completely different things .
until the middle of the Edo period , choshi was used at the beginning of the party and , after sankon , it was switched to tokkuri .
later , they began using tokkuri from the beginning and it is said that , at the end of the Edo period , even daimyo used tokkuri for drinking sake in a drinking party .
katakuchi
katakuchi is a vessel with a pouring spout for pouring sake on its edge .
there are many types of katakuchi that can contain one to two go ( 180 to 360 milliliters ) with various shapes like a bowl , cup and so on .
in the present day , katakuchi is used in place of tokkuri and the usual way to use it is for sake to be first poured from a bottle to a katakuchi and then poured from the katakuchi to a sakazuki .
katakuchi is a traditional eating utensil in Japan which is also used for purposes other than as a container for sake .
Guinomi
Guinomi is a type of sakazuki for drinking sake .
usually , it denotes a sake cup with a bigger size than one called ochoko ( or choko ) .
masu ( measuring container )
Heishi
in the past , it was used to carry sake .
it is not used today .
kawarake ( earthen vessel )
in the Middle Ages , sake was poured into kawarake and dried up in a party of court nobles and high-rank samurai .
it was disposed after one-time use and it was like a portable and disposable sakazuki .
in recent times , it has been used for making an offering of sacred sake or food in Shinto rituals at a shinto shrine .
Suzu ( literally , tin )
it seems to mean heishi made of tin .
it seems tin heishi was used up until the Azuchi-Momoyama period .
in and after the Edo period , such heishi was produced by only one old craft center in Kyoto .
tsunodaru ( literally , keg with horn )
tsunodaru is a keg used as a betrothal gift even today of which upper part is painted red and the lower part with black japan .
the name tsunodaru is derived from the shape of a keg in which the handle is fixed like horn .
Sashidaru
Sashidaru is a black-lacquered square barrel used in the Edo period for carrying sake on one &apos;s shoulder for a cherry blossom viewing party , but it was not seen during and after the end of the Edo period .
Kannabe
Kannabe is a copper or iron pan used for warming sake used during the Heian Period .
it was heated with a direct fire .
Zen
such as takagozen ( high small dining table ) and nakagozen ( small dining table of medium height )
we can say that the meanings of sake and sakana were defined from the outside .
chirori
chirori is a slender metal container used for warming sake .
chirori was made of copper or tin in the past and in recent years there are chirori made of aluminum .
sake is poured into a chirori and warmed by dipping it into hot water .
it is a utensil used in Japanese style pubs and cookshops .
it is not a utensil seen in usual home , but there are cases where chirori is purchased and used personally sticking to sake warmed with chirori .

there are few Buddhism temples , but almost all are Shinto facilities like shrines and hokora ( small shrines )
there are close to forty sake-related shrines in Japan and fifty-five or more gods are enshrined .
there are certain shrines for which the object of worship is limited to koji or water .
it is said that there is no god than what can be identified as a god only for sake like Bacchus in Europe and Du Kang in China .
